US:810874,"Neither party supports Nationalism and the right of White European people to have their own homelands free from forced immigration and miscegenation.

""Be ye separate and Holy"" is another commandment to remain pure. ""Honor thy Father and Mother"" is another commandment to racial purity. We ""Honor"" our parents by having children that look like them. In each of the first five books of the bible, (the Torah), God tells us 7 times in each book, ""No Race Mixing"". God commands us White Israelite/European people to drive off the alien and have nothing to do with them when we encounter them. I can go on! The Jews are not Israel and are not the people of the bible. They are the enemy of God and are contrary to all men, 1Thes 2:13-15, John 8:44-47. I am a racialist and believe scripture. Neither political party supports White people and sovereignty."

US:25694488,Because they actually want to help everyone.
US:38515684,Democrats care about other people not about getting rich at others expense.
US:1120802,"Because entrenched politicians in D.C. have profited from their tenures to the point whereupon entering Congress, getting reelected to multiple terms and maintaining two residences, all on the salary of a Senator or Representative, the magically become multi-millionaires. They become the Uniparty, Swamp if you will and are then loathe to make any changes to the system that interrupts their grifting. Additionally, I feel that once entrenched in office, politicians are more concerned with their own party's political power as well as gaming the system to enhance their own political power within Congress. At that point, they are no longer about me/us, but about acquiring and maintaining power."

US:30988821,Republicans are politicians who DON'T do what their people want or need
US:1985140,"The Democrat party have adopted Hitler's policies widely across the board. They are anti free speech, anti 2A and are pathological liars. They point the finger at everyone else for their own shortcomings."
US:23767,They are the only sensible ones right now. The Republicans are turning us into a fascist state if you care to read any history books.

US:180024447,Democrats are more for the people than Republicans.
US:155093375,I used to be a registered Republican. The current version of the Republican party no longer represents Republican ideals. The current republican party is an embarrassment. President Trump is an embarrassment. His cabinet is an embarrassment. They are taking the country in the wrong direction.
US:40599012,"I am against people pouring into our country illegally. I am pro life. I am not for DEI. I believe there are only two genders. I am anti crime. I believe we are one nation under God.

US:4385985,I don't know
US:1720119,"Democrats have been the closest to my priorities since I started voting. I voted Republican a few times, but once I learned more about things, I saw how wrong I was. Democrats legislate more for interests of Americans like me. Before my disability, I worked as a Pipefitter, even though a few on the local and state level here are allies, they won't be satisfied until unions are a thing of the past. I believe socially as Democrats, not far left progressives. I believe in a hand up to those in need followed by a path forward, job training, counseling, etc. I'm big on climate change. I'm all for equal rights for all, regardless of religion, creed, sexual orientation, etc. I stand firm on separation of Church and State. As a practicing Catholic, I have no right setting an agenda we run the country. I believe in strong public schools and public universities with fully funded budgets. I don't want to hear there's never a reason to terminate a pregnancy because a politician identifies as pro life to win elections. I want sex education at an appropriate age with enough information to cut down on STI's and unwanted pregnancies. As a survivor, I wish mine in freshman year was more than a couple semesters in place of gym class. Maybe I would have spoken up for help sooner. I want to see abortion only in cases of rape, incest, and health of the mother. I want no more free passes for any religious congregation talking politics while making endorsements from the pulpit. I don't want immunity for anyone, including cops. Lastly, after 2015, I believe the biggest threat to America is our bought and paid for judiciary. The obstruction McConnell used blocking that many nominees across all levels to satisfy Leonard Leo and the dark money folks has set us back. We now have hand picked allies in districts where the cases shouldn't be heard setting the stage for everything to go to SCOTUS. There they're set to get rid of experts, agencies, and rights thar will harm America for generations."

US:505728,Because they are more for the poorer people
US:110126849,The Republican Party has chosen to become a cult for one unfit for the office he unfortunately holds. That means only the Democratic Party has a fighting chance of limiting the damage the present occupant of the Oval Office is causing.

US:34068622,I am very conservative and the republican party is more aligned with my views
US:30518058,"We'd really like to know how you think about your key political choices. In your own words, why are you closer to neither the $wording_democratic_nor_republican Party? The politicians of both parties often seem aloof, self-serving, and actually not very widely informed; they seem to be aware of very little actual history, both national and world, most lack logic, most are biased to the point that new evidence contrary to their beliefs has little effect on their opinions. Exceptions are few and appreciated."

US:4588496,"Democrats care sbout the people, not just the wealthy"
US:941486,The democrats lie & tried to hide the fact that Biden was senile. They push disgusting agenda. You are either in their side or you are wrong. No compromise. They push hatred of anyone not agreeing with them. Obama built the holding area for illegals but you heard nothing . Trump used the same holding cells & democrats called him Hitler . Pelosi is to blame for not sending in reserves on Jan. 6th but that’s hidden news. Democrats are to blame for all the illegals in the USA. Democrats are anti biblical values.
US:184245211,I believe in limited government. Eliminate wasteful spending. Eliminate dei so the best qualified individual is hired or promoted. Curtail immigration and stop illegals from crossing the boarder. Stop rioters from looting and destroying property.
US:30497318,The alternative these days is fascism
US:2407967,republicans are even more extreme
US:35989721,"Support the MAGA movement, Make America Great Again"
US:1281234,"They are two heads of the same venomous snake. What we are presented is just a grand stage play, not unlike the WWF/wrestling theater, meant to manipulate and keep people scared, distrustful, and hating each other. However, the cycle always comes back around.....for a while, at least."

US:203805443,None
US:182665931,Republicans have turned away from democratic values and towards not questioning the authoritarian views of trump.
US:245376,because i liked what they use to stand for now i am not like what they stand for at all
US:24933131,Conservative values are more aligned with the Republican Party.
US:137083711,The Democrats are ridiculous in their beliefs now
US:182326937,"My views such as less government spending, gun rights and public safety funding are geared more towards Republicans."
US:707706,"Republicans are not batshit crazy like democrats. Republicans believe in lower taxes, smaller government, conservative values."
US:40949722,"I am a Dem because I believe in personal freedom, the ability to live life as you wish as long as you do not harm others. I believe in helping other countries when they are struggling by supporting their cause for freedom (e.g., Ukraine), providing food or other forms of aid, or helping during a crisis. I believe in immigration because this is a country founded by immigrants. I believe in the rule of law and following the Constitution."
US:170062489,I vote for Democrats and Republicans depending on their vision.
US:4349947,now days the Republican party is the party of the people and they are doing things for the people
US:111739597,I think we believe in what we are fighting for. Democrats are working to better our futures.
US:886594,Because they cannot solve the problem and they don’t think of the people
US:134825095,I think the current GOP is not focused on what is best for most Americas but what the president wants. There seems to be a fear of going against him or even disagreeing with his policies.
US:168171309,"party of compassion, rule of law and moral government"
US:2740379,Republican party has devolved into a criminal organization.
US:3368655,We are a people from all nations and we should be able to voice our opinion when we don't like something. we SHOULD ALL take care of each other. Rich people should NEVER have the right to tell others how to live. WE are NO longer into the slave trade for anyone. EVERYONE is created equal.
US:187792641,I believe in smaller government. I think the democrats lean to far to the left
US:189664613,"Because he is the oldest and most distinguished, and his ideas and aspirations suit me."
US:37605754,Because I am not rich
US:1624910,"I was a republican for a long time. It was the 2016 election of Donald Trump which changed me. I see myself as a moderate - I believe in equality, I believe in freedom, I believe in the US as the main power in the world. All of that has gone away from the GOP. The GOP is now a strange religious death cult. I became a D, and now a strong D because in the end, while I don't agree with everything on that side, I agree with the general intellectual approach and that the Ds believe in things like the rule of law, equality, and global standing. Also, after seeing the GOP tank the economy over and over, my analytical brain said ""stop voting red if you don't want to go broke."" So, here I am, an accidental democrat."
US:180608803,"1. I’m based in reality and science. 2. Law and order 3. Fiscally responsible to our own citizens 4. Morally good 5. We don’t label and/or compartmentalize people 6. We don’t change accents, yell or deceive in communication."
US:1934985,Democrats want to stay in power anyway they can. Legally or illegally. They hate America. They are only interested in their own wealth and lifestyle. Their foul language in public is disgraceful. Hate rules the Democratic Party.
US:205581651,I think Donald Trump is doing a fantastic job as president of the United States. He's fixing numerous issues we face.
US:198191597,"I prefer to let my own thoughts and opinions dictate my actions. I see no reason to lean towards either party, both parties are equally corrupt and I personally don’t want to be associated with either side. I’m on my own side , basically."
US:187891651,"The Democrats are the party of the people, they promote programs that helps all people not just the rich."
US:4482183,I prefer to stay neutral
US:196592207,Because they work for USA
US:204326,They are better for the world
US:25285394,I grew up as a republican
US:199136757,The Republican party has gone off the rails and is destroyed. It’s not a party of conservative values are conservative politics are fiscal responsibility. It is the party of Donald Trump
US:167464473,they support my views
US:4297591,I support a smaller government that supports capitalism and does not select certain groups for special benefits.
US:157880829,Closer to my values
US:196893321,Every day people
US:1758325,like what they say
US:1485481,"I am really a libertarian, the Republican party is closer to my views than the Democrat party."
US:171875041,Because it fits me to a tee honestly
US:945248,Both are far more interested in their own power than in the Constitution of the nation.
US:167130077,I love the democratic party
US:144102289,Forward thinking. Republicans pull us backwards
US:173847589,Democrats are more concerned with social issues. These affect only minority populations
US:2602711,"They are ALL a bunch of liars and thieves. They got elected to fatten their own pockets and don't care at all about the ""little"" people also known as the backbone of the USA."
US:137094779,I have nothing to say
US:104701775,More conservative and responsible
US:2031786,I'm a conservative who values the rule of law. Democrats are completely open to interpreting laws to meet their own ends - which does NOT usually align with the law as intended.
US:1005909,Because Democrats are worthless.
US:4557356,They both suck!
US:4031742,I was a Democrat until they went Socialist. I believe in freedom and government NOT in my personal business!
US:46510028,"Both parties are corrupt and serve the purposes of a ruling class that is robbing the people blind. Both parties support the genocide in Gaza and want to keep sending money and arms to Israel (though I don't believe the American people want that). Both parties try to be hawkish on immigration, where they need to be MUCH MORE POSITIVE. Both parties are horrible. We need an actual left-wing party. The Dems campaigned with LIZ CHENEY that detestable warmonger. I hate both parties."
US:24924331,Democrats are radical leftists who care more about power than anything else. The also seem to care more for Illegals than they do for American citizens!
US:2532513,"Because on most issues, the Democratic party is more attuned to the low and middle class. The Republicans are more inclined to favor the billionaire class."
US:27223772,"The Republican party has become fouled by phony religious claims, and has totally rejected the rule of law in America. I've been a Democrat since John F. Kennedy was president."
US:4370942,I believe that the Democrats are more for the people.
US:22703481,The other options were too liberal and did not consider the longterm effects of their policies.
US:27133163,"As you can see, the other party is non desirable to normal human beings. I have voted for republican candidates in the past...I never will, ever again. Both parties have faults, but the democrats have less and is more desirable for a normal, sensible human being."
US:25440819,I just agree with the policies and beliefs of Republicans over the Democrats...we believe more in the country and bringing it back
US:133057067,Donald Trump.
US:143564507,We just want people to get along and treat everyone fairly.
US:140159349,"The Democratic Party, in the abstract, stands for policies that support ALL of the working class. The Republican Party stands for policies that support rich, white men."
US:196799939,I am for the person who will do the right thing
US:174034439,"Neither party has it right. The Democrats are too busy trying to deny science or use limited scope science to push an agenda that is no where near in keeping with the wishes of the American people. The Republican's spend too much time catering to the rich. While I have never considered myself a Republican, I did, at one time, consider myself to be a Democrat. Nowadays, I'd vote for a pile of cow droppings before I would vote for a Democrat. They are unrealistic, out of touch, and unintelligent."
US:38073065,Because My Party takes action and does what it says...
US:32122833,More open-minded
US:40764440,The party most aligns in my belief structure on how government is supposed to work for the people. Put the people and their welfare first and apply the rule of law equally to every part of the electorate.
US:625108,I don’t particularly care for trump.very obnoxious
US:158510227,I believe in freedom and they more closely align with freedom than the Democrats
US:101792775,I believe in a women's right to chose and I believe in democracy
US:46345305,"I am a libertarian, which places me with Republicans on most economic issues and Democrats on most social issues. I favor free trade and immigration reform, but am against DEI and funding for most domestic programs."
US:885183,"Pro-life, pro-business, strong foreign policy"
US:178680193,"I’m a democrat because I think that all people, regardless of their race, gender, background, or religion should have their opinions heard. Republicans try to suppress the voice of anyone that disagrees with their far right agenda."
US:36854567,Donald Trump
US:181354925,KIND OF THOUGHT THEY WERE FOR THE WORKING CLASS
US:196026713,Democrats are no longer the party of the working man. Too many wacky liberals views.
US:187022085,Because I believe helping the mosr vulnerable and giving everyone a fair chance
US:4577362,Original party i registered with. Thought along these lines. In the last 5 years very disappointed in the party. In current administration is absolutely horrible. Gutting Americans. Modern day euthanasia. And thinking people want to have and raise children in this world right now. DOGE is a f*king joke and has zero idea how Government works. Just costing the government more money in the end.
US:119918729,Because the Democrats live in a world that has no reality.
US:3571538,Republicans are more American friendly
US:545934,They are more conservative than the Democrats. The Democratic party is now socialist. They have gone too far left.
US:28082258,"When I choose to be a Democrat, I felt that it was the party for people who carried about all people."
US:2052555,"Because, TO THIS DAY, they are the ONLY PUBLIC SERVANTS interested in LISTENING to their constituents, even when many of those are MAGAs. Because they are the only ones making sense at this moment. REPUBS have ABDICATED their legislative responsibilities in service and fealty to one man, not their voters! CHAOS reigns in this WH."
US:24122608,To liberal.
US:131280207,"I had been registered as unaffiliated for most of my adult life. The Democrats always deliver better economic results, defend & expand civil rights, and are generally looking out for the People. I switched my affiliation to Democrat when the Republicans went completely off the rails, embraced the corruption of Trump and MAGA, and idealized plans to destroy the societal gains of the last half century. In the America my immigrant ancestors admired, my grandchildren should not have fewer rights than I have enjoyed."
US:23058926,no
US:132783487,"I believe that healthcare is a human right, and that includes women's reproductive care. I believe that new vaccines decreases the severity of a potential virus. I think the focus should be on bolstering the middle class and making the top 10% wage earners pay their fair share in taxes. I believe America should honor our agreements and keep our allies trust."
US:695229,Because I don't want the USA to become a left wing commie country
US:160083499,I agree with some Republicans and some Democrats but not all
US:46545015,They are actually trying to solve problems in this country while also trying to reduce spending. Democrats are trying to spend more on their select groups and projects.
US:1319756,it is the better of the two choices
US:184800349,they aren't doing enough
US:169021687,I never know how to answer these questions
US:4350869,I want things in this country to be fair and honest for everyone.
US:155602447,"This is the party of Common Sense and dedicated to returning the rule of order etc to the States, people."
US:121979575,Republicans are only for themselves and the rich.
US:35876375,I have interests covered by both sides
US:179577763,I am a Democrat because I believe government’s purpose is to make our lives better and solve problems without curtailing basic civil rights
US:203982855,Because they stand for the things that I believe are important and make good sense. Republicans are trying to save our Country.
US:173600587,Empathy for others. All sexes and races should have the same rights.
US:173643479,Too long to list
US:953521,for the most part the democratic party mirrors my own views.
US:114856733,Because they care more about the law and people and not about themselves.
US:39312245,Because Democrats are socialist/communist and against American citizens
US:2357493,They are not self serving crooks like republicans
US:1262235,More commitment to people and less to large corporations and billionaire
US:28279,"Because their policies are closer to mine. I believe in smaller government, lower taxes, much less government interference in our lives. Government should not be in our schools, etc. The Democrat's nanny government and nanny state is anathema to me!!!"
US:177379749,"About 8 years ago, after being a life-long Democrat,(I'm 83 years old) I left the Democratic Party because they left me, their core ideas no longer reflect my positions. They are no longer the Party of the working class, but of far left ideology. Now they haven't any strong leaders or vision. They are being represented by Socialists and Hate Fearing Mongering Idealogs."
US:182222365,The love of the vision portrayed by the party
US:193559759,They have more common sense than Democrats
US:205441099,Because democrats help the less fortunate
US:1582189,Morals
US:201835399,I am a Democrat because most of the time I side with their view on issues.
US:179187863,They support the same issues I do
US:34826173,it is how I was raised and it follows my beliefs
US:31223055,fiscal responsibility abortion is murder less goverment invasion of every single aspect of business and life
US:139404025,because they’re both trash. Both are corrupt and neither is doing anything for the average american worker. a third party should be able to access the same funds that dems and republicans do to run a proper campaign.
US:172252631,My opinion
US:25186974,Because it depends on what the person will do for me
US:2943117,because the democrats are tooo liberal and the republicans generally support the military
US:186835783,I am a Christian and believe in GOD.
US:127259295,"I don’t feel like the Republican party has the same outlook, values and morals that align with mine"
US:116563907,The Democrats and Republicans need to work together.
US:3694599,I like their policies
US:2740804,I'm a Democrat because the Republican Party has sold out to someone who is a conman and a criminal.
US:2267689,"Democrats generally support the average person, not the 1% or big corporations."
US:27479233,They listen to the needs of the people
US:2644452,I don't know
US:4276962,Democrats suck
US:194611817,They hate me less
US:168701603,Both parties seem to be too far to left or right and unwill8ng to compromise. We shouldn’t give the farm away but we also shouldn’t make life harder for people.
US:162801773,"Because the Republicans at this point are waging a war on human rights and American's rights. They started with women's health rights on abortion, have moved onto women's healthcare rights and now are going to all rights - free speech, due process, court orders..."
US:28282453,Because the Democrates are for the people and their rights and the Repuplicans are for rich.
US:41054125,both side has bad and good
US:1682916,"They are more humane in their policy and tend to be on the right side of history. Their policies carry us forward, not backward and support democracy."
US:179628811,I am a Republican because I believe in keeping the government's role limited to ensure individual liberties are protected.
US:41263315,"They are realistic, the democrats give away everything"
US:4542749,"I am a Democrat because I believe this party cares about middle and lower class people, the poor, and migrants. Republicans have become too spineless and let the President do whatever he pleases, even when it's not in the best interest of the country."
US:28973599,Empathy Care for all
US:40971218,"I was a Democrat until I was 51 years old when my eyes were opened. I am a Christian. When a party boos God and makes its major platforms about murdering unborn babies, mutilating minors, grooming children in grade schools, allowing men in women's sports and locker rooms, there is no choice in voting. I am a Republican because it is the party that is the most closely aligned with my religious views, which are what determine my actions. I am a Republican because I watched the government shut down our country based on a threat that did not exist. Covid was not that deadly and the actions taken destroyed businesses, children's learning and development and created mental illnesses in numbers we have not seen in decades. My Governor, Tim Walz turned into a dictator and a sick man offering money and scholarships to those who brought their children in for the deadly pretend vaccine. I am a Republican because even I could see that Biden was suffering from severe dementia even before he was elected and the Dems knew it and they allowed someone else to run and try to ruin our country. The mainstream media are not news shows, they are propaganda and brainwashing trolls that communists would love. I am Republican because I knew the Russia collusion was false, Hunters laptop was real, the impeachments and arrests of Trump were lawfare and January 6th was a set up and infiltrated with FBI and antifa to stir things up. I watched Minneapolis burn and the fake trial and the country go crazy with vandalizing and burning and killing and the Democrats were thrilled with it all. There is a severe sickness in the Democratic party and our news media and it will never align with people who wish to live their lives, protect others, help others and honor truth and service. The Dems are the lowest form of human in our country today. It is a sign. Those who scream their words, who use profanity (which children can hear) and attack, attack and attack are the ones who have the most to lose by Trump being President. They are criminals in my mind. Everyone I know, no matter which party they are in, want these 20 million illegals that the Dems let into the country deported. NOW. The Democrats are the ones using judges to slow everything done. They are all sick and frankly, evil. They hate this country. They hate the people of this country. No one does the things that Schumer, Pelosi, Waters, AOC, Crocket and that stupid shit who talked for 24 hours unless it is all about THEM. They do nothing to work in Congress to help this country. They can only tear down. Those who pushed people to destroy Tesla and Elon Musk are terrified on the money trail in USAID coming back to them. Those pushing for violence should be removed from office. All of these reasons are why I am sure I will be Republican until the day I die. President Trump truly loves this country and has given up more and taken more shit than anyone should have to, to serve his country. I am totally ashamed with the Dems in Congress. Too bad they do not know the meaning of the word, shame."
US:175215363,My people
US:135024081,After Trump was re-elected I ask myself that question everyday. Why am I still a Republican !
US:3031478,Because I believe Republicans have stronger moral values and are in touch/reality with middle and lower.class citizens
US:29509,I want our nation to remain a Democratic Republic with all rights In in our constitution and bill of rights.
US:164439309,Because Democrats have had control too long.
US:130500135,They are interested in what is best for the people.
US:121347853,Because I believe in justice and liberty for all men and we should live in a country where everyone is free.
US:2298732,Because I am more conservative than liberal. I am economically conservative but socially liberal.
US:100874949,I agree with their values
US:23412535,This party represents my ideas and the integrity of our country
US:123456859,Because the Republican policies and agenda most closely align with my beliefs and moral values.
US:3672190,They said Democrats are for the poor people

US:44233318,"I grew up in a very Republican home until Trump's first term..... Now I am embarrassed and a bit apprehensive about even saying I was one. There are so many things these complete and totally brainless, heartless, money-loving morons have done against our own country and The Constitution..... makes me physically ill to think about the time they will remain in office"
US:41131719,"I believe in lifting people up who need help. I support services to the poor, homeless, elderly and disabled. I am Pro-choice. Immigrants enrich our country. People of color are equal. I don’t care who loves who, how much money anyone makes or the color of their skin. Tax the rich!!"
US:170210515,"There's no other choices. If a party existed that better aligned with my views, I would support that party."
US:3714122,"The Democrats at least tend to (or pretend to) promote policies that benefit everyone, not just favor the wealthy at the expenses of the poor and middle class. I'll never vote Republican again, because extremists and ignorant assholes have taken over the party. But the Democrats don't fight back, they just yap on about how bad the GOP is and whine that they can't do anything."
US:45034019,I like to see all people be able to make a living. I like to see all people receive benefits and help.

US:151356893,Why not
US:196670611,"I am fiscally conservative with my money and want a government that is the same. I like small government. I also think that unborn babies have rights and should not be killed, obviously they can't consent to being killed."
US:24360491,Democrats are supposed to work for the common good.
US:2866054,I believe they get more done and their values align better with my own. 10 years ago I would just call myself a Democrat as I believe I could see and vote across the political aisle. Now I call myself a strong Democrat because I can't believe what the GOP is allowing to happen in our counrty and their level of hypocrisy is mind bending.
US:2384262,Because I registered Republican as a teenager and have yet to have a compeling reason to change. I have voted for many Democrats in the past.

US:99965,"they are basically the same, and both worthless"
US:4388959,I don't believe in handouts for no good reason like the Democrats want to do.
US:643193,"Because I believe in freedom of speech and the principals laid down in the US Constitution. People are all created equally and all should be given the same rights to vote no matter what your color, race, rich or poor. And all people should be given the right process of the law no matter what. NOT the will of a deranged president and his lackeys."
US:2391964,Because it is the best party to be a member of.
US:43177,Because the democrats are idiots.
US:46470277,I'm not really. I'm more of a socialist
US:4281017,It's the only major party that's not completely rotten and corrupt.

US:36700908,"Well if you want illegal immigrants, wars in countries, decrease the police involvement YOUR A POS DEMOCRAT"
US:442730,Because they aren't as liberal as Democrats with the people's money
US:127436837,"I’m a Democrat because I believe that the Democratic Party most closely supports middle class, working class and low income Americans. They are more concerned with creating policies that address both social and income inequality."
US:127340015,No real reason
US:401554,"I'm conservative and I'm tired of the liberal nonsense going on in our country. I used to vote for the person but after what I've witnessed in the last 16 years, unless something changes; I'll never vote for a democrat at any level of government."
US:1836309,"I am a conservative. I despise most Republicans almost as much as I do the Democrats. (E.g. It makes me cringe to vote for someone like Sen. Tillis here in NC.) Nonetheless less, I find that most Republicans, whether because of political pressure or by true belief, tend to vote some in accord with my beliefs."
US:25186591,"note sure, both aren’t doing much in the way of being lawful"

US:40573982,"Life, liberty and freedom of choice."

US:180892929,The Republican Party used to be closer to libertarianism. Not so much anymore.

US:42581037,Because I don’t like the policies of the republican’s
US:197663877,I was a democrat for quite qwhile until the progressive faxction slowly started it rise. The quintessential moderate or cenrtristhas vanished. That party is the far left and the overeducated coastal liberal now. Which one will destroy the p[arty first. Im not a Rep but closer because they are more logical.
US:187113865,Democrat are very honest people
US:30591192,I believe in fighting for the people
US:170731037,Because the Democratic party is fighting for people like me and for our freedom of choice

US:40902796,I support the Democratic platform
US:3706008,I've been for many years. I wouldn't change that.

US:181820597,I agree with Bernie Sanders push for Medicare for all as we are spending the most money in healthcare with least amount of positive outcome with for Profit Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies
US:168623187,for the people
US:135240067,Because they're both terrible.
US:138677011,i think so of the things they do make more since
US:4102823,"I have followed politics for many years and I used to vote Democrat, but as I’ve grown older I am convinced that they are for the most part a pack of thieves and liars and the party should be dissolved or reformed extensively and brought back to common sense. Period"
US:176911157,I have no comment
US:40545848,Because their values align with my own.
US:171505951,I don't think we need parties. It divides people. Neither side is right on everything. They fight each other instead of fixing issues.
US:160752397,"Close the border, deport illegal aliens, voter ID, end fraud, waste and sbuse, DOGE every spending bill,politicians, elon misk DOGE California government from Savtsmento down to all leftist tim cities."

US:124934653,I'm for God and country.
US:102837679,Neither party is getting things done for regular working class people.
US:106818053,Because they are more conservative than Democrats.
US:41880172,I feel the republican party is more for the working class and their agenda is more of how I feel our country should be.
US:252103,A republic buffers gut-reactions to avoid mobocracy. Pure democracies can be dangerous and destructive when they become driven by emotion rather than logic and long-term thinking.
US:1463449,"I used to identify as a Democrat in the seventies, but the party moved away from supporting blue collar workers and transitioned to identity politics and ""Wokeness"" leaving me behind. While agreeing with some Republicans ideas, the party as a whole does not represent my views in any real sense."
US:4291159,I want freedom.
US:36885750,"Democrats are responsible compassionate people, and care about the wellbeing of others"
US:173394155,I don’t feel like I’m I think I just in the middle
US:164392093,Because they provide a safety for people in need and care about more than billionaires
US:3375538,We are dedicated to preserving traditional America.
US:149151643,because i believe in human rights and civil liberties
US:26194102,Their policies and how they want to run the country align with mine get rid of only legal aliens no matter what two genders two sexes male female only that's it and stop the Democratic look towards from being such whiny ass f****** babies
US:2558435,"Because the Democrat politicians are only interested in raw power. Just in the past 4 years we have seen an administration that used the Justice Department against their political adversaries. They swept in a mentally diminished president and maintained him despite the risks to 330 Million people, and when it was clear he could not win and the nation knew he was non compos mentis, they Undemocratically installed another candidate."
US:2646941,I'm in the majority of the polling that gives congress the worst approval rating ever
US:4585355,because I actually care about people and can empathize and feel
US:44489967,because it is the right choice
US:241829,"Limited govt, states rights, protect the unborn, lower taxes, protect women against trans nonsense"
US:186102243,"My values align with the Republican Party. I don’t promote abortion, illegal aliens coming into the u.s., I don’t support criminals, dei, transgender agenda, men in women’s sports, rapist, murders, or Democrats."
US:136386101,"Republicans have become a cult party in their featy to Trump, MAGA, violence, racism, mysogyny, birtherism, conspiracy theories, billionaires, Nazism, etc."
US:125578563,no
US:2480369,fredom
US:187461569,"Because the MAGA movement under Trump is leaning into authroitarianism as Trump is backing fascist, white, male ideaology"
US:179810411,Both parties are bought and paid for they do not represent the people but the corporations who lobby them
US:122218845,I was raised to be a Democrat growing up that's why.
US:172850719,Democrats support important social issues and safety net issues. Republicans oppose safety net issues and support issues that discriminate against classes of people. Republicans want to tear down the separation of church and state.
US:34154111,I believe in that party more
US:413421,I WAS an independent that was neither close to either party. I voted for who was closest to what I believed in and wanted for others and myself. But this republician party is no longer aligned with what they use to be. They are totally a different party and worship and bend the knee to their king. We do not have a person who follows the law or constitution.
US:119069121,"Both parties sold their loyalty to Israel, and the military industrial complex, and are working against the interests of the American people"
US:206689041,i am not sure
US:4696576,Because my views and beliefs are more in line with democrats and their ways:
US:46355316,"The left wing is off the rails, and it is loony."
US:30934358,I am more conservative
US:1024893,The Republican have a ton of more common sense than the Democrats who have turned into a joke.
US:4274617,I believe in our constitution. I also believe in a woman’s right to choose. I believe you cannot override the constitution. We have separation of state and church. We cannot run over these values.
US:140343559,I would like less government and curtailment of spending. I don’t see either party working to balance our budget. I also think neither party follows the law and utilizes presidential power to push policy on people. Congress is weak and this is both parties. Let local people determine laws in their states.
US:28892150,"I'm a Democrat because I believe in making sure everyone has equal rights. I believe in making sure women are equal to men when it comes to income, Job opportunities, and safety. I believe in making sure minorities have the same rights as white people."
US:339849,I have always been a Democrat as long aI was eligible to vote. I was raised that way.
US:2566153,I think the Republican party is on its way to becoming the Republican Nazi party of the USA.
US:112846673,"The Democrats have historically been the party of the ordinary working class and middle class American. They have attempted to offer the majority of Americans a better socio-economic opportunity to upward mobility in our country; they have been abandoned by white working class American males based on a misunderstanding of the tenants of the Republican party, i.e. represent the rich and powerful at all costs- Elon Musk and the talented billionaire oligarcy."
US:2092695,"Respect for people w/o regard to race, gender, ethnicity, orientation; respect for our Constitution and the right to vote; commitment to due process and the rule of law. Republicans -- elected officials and the people who support them -- share none of those values."
US:29688019,Both parties have good ideas and bad ideas.
US:2956498,"Neither as a party have the best interest of America at heart, and neither, as a party, follow the constitution. Both parties are willing members of the Deep State and The Uniparty."
US:159110259,Because I believe in most everything Republicans believed in prior to most of them becoming MAGA.
US:36479134,Republicans want to do what's best for our country but Democrats just want to do what is best for them and the Democratic party.
US:672042,"The Republican Party actively works to take away my rights as a naturalized citizen, immigrant, and woman of color. The Democrats do nothing to defend democracy in the United States and are not progressive enough for me to align with them as a party."
US:31145307,"Both are dogmatic, both make horrible decisions"
US:2825383,democrats have no plan no policy only oppose
US:21633,I hate the religious right
US:24858805,I believe in smaller gov and more personal responsibility.
US:966316,Alot of reasons
US:148449893,All Democrats are Marxist.
US:146186243,"Freedom of speech, freedom of what I do with my body, protecting the rights of all people, equality and so much more."
US:39820822,0ur freedom
US:44901343,"The political system in America is two sides of the same coin. Lobbying has destroyed any semblance of the two party system. Congressmen/women are open to the highest bidder and/or being blackmailed to give big corporations whatever they want. The Supreme Court hasn’t followed the Constitution for a very long time. The agencies (CIA,FBI et al) have never been what we the people were told they were created to do; to keep America safe from foreign entities intent on harm to us. They were created to infiltrate other countries and control other countries to the best interests of the United States. Now, these same agencies are being trained on the American people. The people who are sick and tired of the agendas, lies, and propaganda being fed to us by a captured press."
US:176955665,"I believe in the commons, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, and freedom of thought and expression. Everything else is negotiable."
US:4357295,Both parties have strayed to extremes and have lost touch with the true ideals of their party.
US:183250517,My views align best with Republican candidates.
US:201883303,"I think Democrats work more to help all Americans, not just wealthy ones"
US:39460822,Feel they are more compassionate and kind
US:1159389,Because Democrats have always stood up and represented the average citizens and not bowed down to the billionaire class.
US:1479474,I've heard the democrats talk. That's way
US:819999,Because big government doesn’t help the middle and working class and it is taking away true freedom. It is destroying us and the democrats are all about big government and control and social programs and saving us from ourselves by stripping away our freedoms little by little.
US:28702767,I'm a single mom that struggles financially I work hard and still don't get paid enough. I have to budget and inflation hurts my finances.
US:28778303,"I believe in fairness, compassion, helping the downtrodden, truth, justice, and the American. I'm against the stupidity, corruption, avarice, greed, and meaness of the Republicans"
US:134905865,The Constitution is enormously important and needs to govern all our decisions and point the way forward.
US:206756117,"Because they have always fought for the vast majority of Americans, whereas the Republicans seem to have always wanted to protect the rich"
US:24868092,"Both parties are an embarrassment to this country. They simply want to get re-elected. They are kowtowing to lobbysits and lining their pockets, while we ""average"" people are getting screwed."
US:173316067,"I define myself as a republican, rather than democratic, because I believe that any true republican sticks to traditional values and principles. I like to keep those traditional values such as; respect for authority/elders, as this helps maintain discipline and general respectfulness. It also helps maintain stability in personal family relationships and societal relationships. Moral values and being able to know and choose what is right and what is wrong. I personally believe that this is the exact opposite of what the democratic viewpoints and goals are."
US:181029451,"Believe in equality , in democracy, and see republicans as liars who mess up the economy and increase the deficit while saying that they are fiscal conservatives"
US:184831129,It a good look for the states
US:188851393,The opinions they have more align with my own views.
US:40455808,"I believe in the rule of law and that government should work for the least well off of the nation, not the most well off."
US:35774641,I support freedom of choice and common sense approaches to issues.
US:146569343,They are more liberal than the Republican Party and have similar views to my own
US:43412611,"Because the Republican party represents Honesty, Integrity, True sence of how things should be run in our government! Business minded!"
US:173711639,"Democrats care about social justice, the environment and the rule of law. Most Dems are not full of themselves"
US:187555567,my values and beliefs align with the republican party. also the democrats have gone way to crazy and nation destroying.
US:137747145,Because I’m middle of the road
US:107382485,because republicans are pure evil and third parties act just as useless as all the other parties without even having any political power
US:167690135,They often don't do right to help the people.
US:110061661,I BELIEVE IN THEM
US:573073,Because Democrats are insane and lie.
US:28383797,It means working people come first not the ultra rich.
US:188435997,"I believe women should be able to get abortions up to 3 months, do not agree with woke democrat issues"
US:34480689,There is no party to the left of Democrats.
US:1492468,The Republican party generally represents my opinions about the welfare of the nation.
US:179051839,Beliefs along more with mine than other parties
US:191976925,They represent the normalcy I want in life. Life should not be too complicated like other sects make it to be. Republicans are close to how I perceived the world.
US:174510549,I believe people should work to earn a living not wait for the government to give them free money. I don't believe in abortion at any amount of weeks. I believe if people want to come to the US they should do so legally!
US:505145,"Are you kidding? Look at the racist, misogynistic, homophobic christofasists of the patriarchal GOP, akin to the Taliban or mullahs of Iran. They are speedily destroying every progressive advance of the last century and attempting to destroy our secular democracy, secular because the deistic Founders created it as such, in favor of theocracy and oligarchy. Furthermore, they are destroying the middle class, secular public education, access to higher education, and public health in order to create a sick, illiterate, and desperately poor populace unable to fight the increasingly powerful oligarchy and more likely to turn to the fairy tale of religion, just like it was in the Middle Ages. Key to all of this is to return women to the home to remain barefoot and trapped pumping out soldiers, laborers, and parishioners for the wealth and clerical class as it once was in feudal times. Rolling back women's reproductive rights and even the franchise as some in the GOP are seeking to do is the overarching goal. And don't get me started on the sick Republican obsession with eliminating gay and transgender rights. If able, they'd also willingly take up the cause of the old Southern Democrats of the Civil War era and return blacks and probably Hispanics or any dark skinned person to servitude. They value wealth, white European lineage, and the authoritarianism of Iron Age religion above all else and refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund a healthy, highly educated, and well functioning society. As for destroying the environment and ignoring catastrophic climate change, if there's money to be made, they couldnt care less. And finally the GOP is increasingly aligned with fascist leaders such as Victor Orban and Vladimir Putin, enemies of multicultural secular democacry. Republicans are the antithesis of everything that America has come to mean for the average American who is not a wealthy, heterosexual, Christian male. The Democratic Party has its problems, primarily being they are too far to the right in comparison to The Left of Europe and not agressive enough in fighting for the working class as they were in the era of FDR and JFK, but they are the only choice in our two-party system for this highly-educated, very liberal, fully progressive, environmentally aware, atheistic woman."
US:195964929,I believe both parties do no have the best interest of the country at heart and only seek to grow their power
US:500025,the 2 party system perpetuates the problems
US:1795968,They prioritize actual long term well being of people and the country. They use logic and science to make laws.
US:2154710,Because I don't know why
US:40751771,I agree with our policies and ideals
US:1498458,Because the Republican party has lost it's way and has become a threat to our freedom.
US:46346460,"I agree with the positions of Democrats much more than Republicans, and a vote for anyone other than a major two party candidate is a throwaway."
US:173666495,Because I am a liberal and value democracy.
US:26689220,"Although the Democratic Party doesn't completely align with my values, they do so much more than the Republican party does."
US:1452858,"Because they fight for more conservative choices based on what's morally right, tough choices have to be made for the good of all, not just a few diverse groups."
US:45004983,Mostly because my beliefs align with Republicans views
US:200188113,Republicans are literally trying to destroy the world right now. Do i even need to say anything else?
US:132486697,They seem more inclined to listen to the people.
US:125398021,"I was a Republican until Trump got nominated in 2016, knowing some of his background I knew he would make a horrible president. My reason for being a Republican was a fiscal conservative one. I realize now that was not the case. Republicans are not conservative but are controll freaks."
US:2610151,they support issues I agree with
US:134700643,I have no clue why I’m democrat my parents and friends are democrats
US:4540660,Because I believe in democracy and freedom
US:40194712,Each and every issue is different and I am not one to side with democrats nor republicans on every issue like today’s democrats and republicans do. I can evaluate each issue and decide which way I would vote.
US:41552447,better than being a democrat
US:163996781,"Used to be a Democrat, but the party became too left wing and left me"
US:165991839,"I was a Republican until the January 6 insurrection and Trump. After those two events, I became independent. I do not identify with the MAGA Trump Republicans. I am independent now. I like that the Democratic Party looks out for the environment and wants to regulate big business."
US:41802865,I believe in their ideals
US:2678516,They are more for the people
US:125649539,The other party stands for NOTHING. I am not into that b.s.
US:184508483,"Government has lost touch with the people. They are focused on what they can gain financially and publicly, instead of the constitution and the voice of the people. They have their own agendas and no longer look at what is best for those who voted them in."
US:1885183,"We the people, all of us, not some, should reap the benefits of of our hard work. Our hard earned tax dollars should help us, not rich people that already have enough. Too many of us have fallen and there is no money to help us rise, but there always seems there is enough money to to help a rich person get a new yacht."
US:26001005,That seems to be the party with the most moral
US:44464788,Political parties are more interested in beating the other party and not doing what is right
US:203697687,Just am democrats are evil
US:40612866,Not very conservative but a whole lot closer than the democrats
US:25270743,We need to help each other.
US:3652422,This is a tradition in my family.
US:24044539,"Because no one or no organization is always right and they need to be listening to each other, doing the proper research and fully discussing things before making a decision, policy, or law."

US:461866,I agrree with the Republicans on economic and social issues but disagree on questions of personal responsibility like abortion
US:124008439,Because. They generally support the values that I believe in

US:40777905,It is the right thing for the nation
US:3994727,"Neither Tweedle Dem nor TweedleRep understand the NEED FOR COMPROMISE on issue like immigration, nor the significance of national DEBT."
US:181724949,Conservative values more closely reflect my faith.
US:184659827,"I consider myself a leftist, not a Democrat. My closeness to the Democratic Party is mostly a matter of political necessity—there is no viable mainstream alternative that aligns even remotely with my values. The Republican Party has shifted so far to the right, embracing authoritarian, exclusionary, and often anti-democratic ideologies, that I could never support it in its current form. I used to identify as a Marxist, but over time I’ve come to see that Marx's framework doesn’t fully capture the realities of our current technofeudal era. So while I still care deeply about justice, equity, and dismantling systems of oppression, I now simply call myself a leftist."
US:1922876,I am totally against the two party system and against buying an election which is happening all the time.
US:37091193,not sure
US:172310643,"The democrat party has become too violent in presenting their causes, and don't seem to have common sense. They are on the wrong side and violently promoting 80-20 issues"
US:300316,dont like the decisions the democrates have been making
US:140834119,"Because the left is hateful, resentful, racist, and out of touch!"

US:128217829,Democrats are very close of communism
US:26168856,they listen to the people
US:147887091,I believe that government should be helping people not billionaires and corporations.
US:268330,"It's the smarter choice, Republicans use there heads, and not buy into propaganda and psyops"
US:195668697,I believe in some of the same issues that other democrats are in favor of
US:940662,"It's because I grew up in a very liberal state. And I suffered a lot of abuse from it. I was hated for being from a ""different"" subculture and for my religion. I was also sexually harassed and abused in a liberal school system. No one helped me, and I couldn't get any help because I was only a kid. Later on, I was raped by an acid dropping liberal boyfriend. It's a fact that under liberalism, violence against girls and women has skyrocketed. Even liberal feminists admit this is a problem. And yet, people defend it. God knows why, because this supposed ""progressive"" movement is full of hatred and abuse. I can post more examples, but this statement would turn into a book! In a nutshell, liberalism is the opposite of what they claim to be. They're nothing but lying hypocrites!"
US:142887533,"I believe in the sovereign citizen making self interested decisions about his or her life. I believe in the natural rights, Nature and Nature's God. I am not a leftist know it all."
US:2728494,what?
US:41888239,Because I Relate to the ideals and principals of the Republican party
US:130448433,I don’t follow politics
US:156354275,My views tend to be more conservative.
US:23837436,It represents middle class people
US:2451008,They represent my views on freedom of speech and against illegal immigrants.
US:37130138,i just changed from democrat to republican last month because the democrats have lost their minds and i don't share their values anymore.
US:42207528,democrates have become to liberal
US:39862318,"The party believes in human rights and freedom for all people. They understand cutting taxes for the wealthy only puts an undue burden on the middle class. They are not perfect, but they stand on issues I believe in."
US:2673688,I believe they have the best policy for our country Dems destroy our country
US:2384615,"The are both the same, just different words, same shitty actions."
US:4322743,I vote for the person not the party. Many or even most in both parties are not good.
US:204662217,Capitalism makes life hard for many. Compassion and help goes a long way to keep out population safe and healthy.
US:128375305,I feel that the Democratic Party is more the voice of the people. I feel the Republican party has lost its way and is now the party of special interests.
US:190828781,Neither comes close to representing my views or stances
US:4311983,dont like either one of them
US:199548479,"Fiscal responsibility, they don't obviously hate white men like Democrats, they aren't race baiters like Democrats, they discourage riots like BLM. Jan 6 was orchestrated by the Deep State."
US:187871849,Democrats do not work in the best interests of the working population.
US:3157804,Care about people. Care about human rights.
US:161636355,I just want to side with the group that is more concerned with my income bracket and can make decisions that affect me positivily.
US:128311165,The Democrats have become bat-shit crazy and do not care about the people that they are supposed to represent in this country.
US:197495471,Because Democrats represent my interest better than Republicans.
US:4177817,"I believe in smaller federal government, securing the border, balanced budget, protecting the Constitution of the United States, especially 2nd amendment, following the rule of law defined by the Constitution."
US:41817062,"I'm Christian, believe in strong borders, 2 genders, marriage between a man and a woman and I see decades of failures for Black families in Democrat governed cities as blatant racism."
US:1557791,"The Republican Party has a better platform. It is not perfect, but better understands the constitution and preserves liberty. The average Republican desires to conserve what is good about America. The Democratic party promotes destructive ideas, uses manipulative language and misguided policies to push our people away from founding principles"
US:720507,"Both have lost touch with reality. We need a solid centrist government. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative, with clear laws that are followed and enforced"
US:483272,The Dem Party adheres to my values most of the time
US:4787303,"Because it’s clear that Democrats revel in evil intent, have no concern for the American people and would rather destroy what is righteous and good"
US:128542933,It is a strong reaction against the craven actions of Donald Trump and the sycophantic behavior of congressional republicans. I am so deeply disappointed in the Republican party for their failure to contain and minimize the lies of Trump.
US:32864879,I think most are not interested in the people they represent. They are more interested in their opinions . We the people are tired of them. When they break the law put them in prison. Some of this me first would stop.
US:4353106,I believe that Democrats represent the average person in our country.
US:23138750,Not sure
US:184003113,"I'm not a party guy, but the Republicans have slid so far right, it is tough to align myself with them."
US:177337475,I like some of the policys that Rebulicans believe and I like some that the Democrats believe
US:41067806,i idenitied with the working people and poor foreign groups
US:91025,Because I believe in our country and the rule of law
US:3398334,I'm a Democrat because most of their policies align with my values -
US:193009,"They at least pay lip service to foundational Constitutional principles. Dems want to ""evlove"" the Constitution and twost it to suit socialist ends that are contrary to the original intent of the Framers"
US:40648400,Because they're still reasonable and haven't become a cult like the republicans.
US:198679331,"I am a populist Republican (MAGA) Because it is COMMON sense. Liberals are now radical and ridiculous. I used to be a Democrat, no more. They are disrespectful and liars now. This is NOT the party of JFK anymore. The WOKE agenda has taken over on almost ALL categories."
US:38507493,they both tell us lies
US:40533121,we do not want aborition god comes first and we stand united
US:187867819,Because I'm moderate in my opinions.
US:2653748,"In my experience, Dems seem to be more for the people and the GOP stands with corporations, but that’s slowly changing."
US:3589237,not today.......
US:130477757,"Because they are the only ones that are sane and seem to want what is best for all the people, not just themselves."
US:27470485,"Democrats are most aligned with what the majority of Americans want, stand for and believe are necessary in a strong Democracy. I identify with Democratic values the most."
US:2053008,I did not like the radical liberal direction the Democrat party was taking the nation.
US:1518959,Because they at least try to help all Americans not just give tax breaks to people generally don't need them.
US:1698171,Fewer liars than other parties.
US:105918299,I feel Democrats represent the thought of liberal people.
US:125980307,Because the Democrats are corrupt and trying to destroy America with open boarders inflation and not following the rule of law if it concerns them.
US:1145566,Both parties instill hostility and divisiveness and I do not see either one actively trying to understand and work with the other side. Both parties seem to have allowed their extremists to take the lead.
US:37829205,they both are incompetent
US:170694627,"Because I care about people, the planet, and democracy. I’m sick of hearing about mass shootings every day, of decent people being deported, of the gov’t being dismantled, of essential programs being destroyed. I’m also not a racist. I don’t think business are the answer to problems, big business is the problem. Reganomics is not good policy."
US:271801,BECAUSE I NEVER AGREE COMPLETELY WITH EITHER PARTY ON ISSUES.
US:33255859,most of their beleifs align with mine
US:190748885,I share same values with them
US:2211405,"Because I believe that government should reduce income inequality, ensure equal rights, address global warming, provide health care, food security, safety, and create a tax structure that demands the rich pay their fair share."
US:31512406,The Republican platform most closely aligns with my personal values and views.
US:4276813,The party aligns with most of beliefs.
US:125291393,"I’m disappointed in the Democrats who serve in Congress for not actively carrying out their oath of office to defend and protect the US Constitution against domestic enemies like Trump and MAGA, but Independents only split the vote and Republicans are increasingly serving the authoritarian fascist Trump. So, registering as a Democrat was my only option if I wanted to vote in primary elections."
US:134963741,"Republicans support Trump, have become a cult following a megalomaniac. I fear climate change and Democrats are more likely to support actions to reduce global warming."
US:194357033,I’m a Republican and always have been since Democrats are too evil and liberal
US:161071437,because Republicans allowed this current ass to ruin America with his actions
US:3988415,Neither know what they're doing
US:187904911,No comment
US:139928911,Dems are commies
US:35586292,"Policies supported by the party have the best chance of improving the lives of citizens, from financial security to an improved environment."
US:191875145,I believe people have rights
US:25540670,"The Dem party is closest to my views. It's corrupt and inept, but closer to my views."
US:39478961,"I'm a Republican, because they care more about America then the Democrats do."
US:147685417,"I'm a humanist. I believe in basic human rights, and those include life, liberty, in the pursuit of happiness. If life is one of those rights – that means health. that means every American deserves to be able to eat, to have secure shelter, and be able to take care of their body on the most basic levels. Liberty requires that you feel able to do things. This is not permission. This is ability. Liberty doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want, but it does mean you can discuss and have the opportunity to explore options and situations. If you transgress others' liberty, that is an infringement of their rights. With liberty you are not punished for thoughts or expressions, nor are you forced to accept others thoughts or expressions. Once your life and health are guaranteed, and your ability for free thought are guaranteed, you get the ability to pursue happiness. This is an individual thing. I believe that while the Democratic Party is not great at this, they understand that collective good – results in individual freedom. The whole point of government should be collective good, not selective control."
US:168196209,"The Democrats have gone crazy. Coddling criminals, DEI, illegal aliens, gender theory, teaching sex to children, abortion up to the 9th month. All of it is crazy."
US:3493687,Policies are more.for.the people.
US:171405465,I do not to help 'Make America Go Away'.
US:186883441,they fight for whats right and for the working class
US:4496364,Both groups tend todo what is best for them not the people they represent
US:40354776,The alternative is the destruction of America and democracy.
US:4359943,"Because we care about our country, we do not take immigrants first and our own citizens second, Joe Biden destroyed the country, let's face, it a loser Democrat."
US:129553121,The democratic party mostly aligns with my best interests
US:178490747,"They are less greedy, power happy, and selfish. Although this could be because they have less choices."
US:2927517,"Up until 9/11/2001, I was a democrat. And after that difficult period, I started to see a shift in the democratic platform that didn't resonate with my love of this country. My observations even began to lead me to believe that many democrats actually hate the United States. It's my feeling that Republicans demonstrate more love of country and the allowance for anyone to be the best they can be through learning, hard work and creating a sense of individual self worth. Democrats seemingly want to take the financial achievements from those people described above and give to those unwilling to apply themselves to have a better life. Even when a democrat gets elected, most republicans and/or conservatives, though disappointed, can accept the defeat and move on. Not democrats! Many of them demonstrate an absolute, unabiding hatred for anyone that doesn't think like they do, or believe in what they believe. And so many turn to hateful, hurtful and destructive violence. I don't see that kind of behavior with many republicans or conservatives."
US:1857398,Democrats respect & honor the constitution!
US:1548470,"I feel we would be best served by a government at all levels that is lean, efficient and honest. While no party achieves this, the Republicans come closest. Having recently visited some formerly communist countries, I saw first hand the terrible effects of far left governments."
US:169320249,I don't want to answer because Republicans are wrongfully criticized and put into an unfair category.
US:35364319,Republicans most if the time have the same thought
US:147441541,It most closely aligns with my thoughts.
US:790381,"Putting AMERICAN CITIZENS first, against anchor babies, closing the border, deporting ALL illegals! High morality, honesty, rid DEI in companies, schools, including the elimination of Transgender policies! Want more?"
US:118207,"I care about diversity in the nation. It makes us stronger. It’s of the utmost importance to protect free speech, give money to public stations like PBS and NPR. All sources are asking questions. The blue collar workers and unions were valued by Democrats. The working poor, to raise minimum wage. To tax the rich to provide a safety net to people. Keep thing like Head Start, WIc, help with energy bills. Take things that work like in Europe. Mass transportation, clean energy, health insurance. Ban Monsanto. Eliminate Citizens United. Do ranking for election. Fact check all claims, help the people, get rid of No Child Left Behind, reform how much money can be given to candidates, equal amount for each one…"
US:158969295,"Because I feel it is the party of the people, not just the rich."
US:1340836,Because the GOP has become pawns of the religious right and fully embraced FASCIST doctrines.
US:39574060,Republicans are working to better the country
US:31329347,They are in line with my views
US:26692561,Conservative values. Help give people an opportunity for a leg up but do not destroy their personal value by taking care of them for a lifetime
US:127487439,i have no idea about each party persay i choose the person i think is better the lesser of 2 evils
US:190895685,Because I believe the democrats party could make the economy better again
US:178369589,The Democrat Party has gone way to far left. They're insane.
US:34602596,"I believe in liberal values, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. I believe in the free market, but recognize that it can be abused by powerful interests, so I believe government has a role to play to protect citizens from that abuse. I believe in the rule of law and due process. The Democrats are the only major political party in America who hold values similar to mine."
US:1028674,"I'm a democrat because I believe in equality, freedom and justice. This country was founded by the people and for the people. Democrats represent the ideals of democracy best."
US:3447078,I am a Republican. I believe the government is. for the people by the people. I believe that the country should benefit the people and the needs of the people and should take presidents over political agendas.I feel the Republican party does this.
US:30392681,Always have been
US:2831523,Because republicans have no regard for the constitution for personal freedom and for equality for all.
US:46330999,"Both of them represent their own personal interests and not mine. Both of them are strongly pro-war, I'm anti-war. Neither of them gives a crap for universal healthcare in the US. Both of them are terrible on free speech. Etc. Etc. Etc."
US:3779200,Family members were democrats; liberals are usually democrats; belief in democratic principles
US:29698994,"Most of their ""promises"" are more to my beliefs."
US:111194819,Because the Republicans are insane.
US:210580,I believe in personal responsibility and that the government has a certain purpose and does not become a nanny state
US:185078401,Im more conservative and believe in traditional American values
US:648910,Because Democrats like to give more money away instead of a person being able to stand on his own two feet.
US:43841485,"Because the MAGAs in the Republican party have lost their sense of reality! They have allowed themselves to be manipulated by an authoritarian administration. As, a result, the Republican party has become the party of racist, sexist,homophobic,transphobic, xenophobic, isolationist, Russian sympathisers who live each day in office to destroy our Constitution, thumb their noses at the rule of law, and support a seditious, narcissistic, sociopath in his fantasy to become a dictator and shred every scrap of the constitution he can get in his felonious, perverted, uncouth, tiny little heathen hands! The Republicans are now fully a CULT and have ceased to be a dignified, orderly, intelligent, political party. There are only two types of Republican voters… the uneducated, cultists who believe only the propaganda manufacturers by the Dictator and his minions, OR the greedy, rich, selfish oligarchs who shovel money back and forth to maintain their hedonistic thrones of power and wealth. I would not vote Republican again…for ANY reason! While the Dems are not perfect, thwy at least have not completely sold their aouls to maintain power!"
US:29379181,I believe in what the Democrat Party used to stand for. Right now it's a bit muddled. We have to make ourselves heard: WE ARE THE PEOPLE and we care for ALL PEOPLE.
US:156104379,"Despite the lies from the Democrats, Republicans care more about the common middle class people than Democrats. In fact, Democrats get many times more donations from the rich fat cats on Wall Street than do Republicans."
US:1019166,.what?
US:1461337,Neither reflects my opinion
US:185811909,"I have voted for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I believe we need new or updated parties and a different type of government, possibly similar to a parliamentary system. It seems as if no party is really effective currently, and actually, it seems the Republican party is going full fascist."
US:1609272,Democrats are people who believe in people's right not politicians
US:41870655,"They are more aligned with freedom for everybody, including health care and education."
US:168889139,Better economic policies and positions on social issues.
US:1839042,"Lower taxes, strong military, dump DEI, strong economy, secure our borders."
US:105775279,I care about social issues and the working class.
US:173737873,"I believe in we the people. That means equality for all regardless of color, sexual identity, religion, etc. I support all folks should be given the opportunity to fulfill the American dream. Democrats support programs for these populations."
US:185401273,I don't like any parties I like to be my own independent.
US:151854829,I really don't care for either group.
US:3044061,Republicans are more conservative. Conservatism is more inline with human nature.
US:530428,I believe in the Constitution and personal responsibility
US:172752429,Because I think both parties suck in their own ways
US:170896889,No real reason
US:1464151,More common sense
US:140678779,"I used to vote for who I thought was the best candidate but I probably will not vote Republican again, ever."
US:22928624,Habit
US:4275716,They are more conservative
US:3694368,Because the republican platform is closest to my political beliefs.
US:2973721,"They represent my beliefs and views, Democrats divide us, only interested in illegals, LBQ, DEI, no commonsense!"
US:178542535,"Because I believe in the power and rights and freedoms of the people: right to choose, free speech, freedom of the press, etc. I believe diversity is an asset and everyone has rights. I don’t believe in boosting benefits to the rich—I believe in trying to help all people including with socialized healthcare and welfare programs…"
US:338060,I am a Republican because we have a binary political system and Democrats suck ass.
US:665804,ALL Democrats are liars.
US:184534325,the $wording_democratic_nor_republican Party This question is unclear
US:142182279,liberal views
US:187008105,I believe in strong borders and a strong military
US:4535188,they listen and do what they say they'll do
US:4423644,am more liberal than conservative
US:42024728,"I believe in equity for all, freedom of speech and the letter of the law. Too much exclusion has been happening with regard to the republican way of thinking."
US:2089731,Like more of the things they as a party represent
US:107599031,Republican Party agrees with most of my beliefs. I believe in freedom of speech (with NO censorship). Strong borders. Against DEI. Transgender men should not be permitted to participate in women's sports. Any immigrant that comes to our country should assimilate into our culture and language.
US:193873543,I'm glad you asked! I was a strong Republican for 48 years. Then Trump came along. I remained a Republican throughout his first term so I could fight the evil that he is from within. But when Biden won in 2020 I switched to the Democratic party. And now with the Republicans being what they are I will never be one again.
US:27228427,I think Democrats are often watered down Republicans in that they look out for themselves first.
US:166681195,Want our nation protected and have people deserve and work to be in our country.
US:2946572,The republicans want less government power and control and listen to the peoples desires and needs.
US:118780723,I would say republican. But haven’t seen any good evidence republicans are with all of the people.
US:192808819,"I believe in helping all people no matter their color, political leaning, sexuality, or gender. I believe everyone should be able to choose what is best for their family and body. I believe there is good in most people."
US:128328333,Democrats and Republicans both only serve the interests of themselves and their corporate lords.
US:129922473,I am a Democrat because we share the same ideals.
US:24937779,"In the past, I have felt closer to the Republican Party but the current administration has pushed me away. The Democrats are too unorganized as it currently stands - they are all over the map on issues."
US:43219292,Because republicans these days follow trump too much. They don’t stand up to him for what is right.
US:190698643,"I support a living wage, the 1st Amendment rights, and actions to curb the growing threat of climate change."
US:1929859,I don't trust either main party. I study the candidates and vote for who I perceive will be best for the country.
US:128990743,Has more of my values than republicans.
US:35166359,I am a democrat because I believe that social change is important and society needs to advance socially and economically to new ideas.
US:825559,They're the same thing. Both are horrible outdated choices that rely on people arguing back and forth about stupid things instead of getting the job done.
US:3120069,I lean toward more moderate views.
US:1492299,"My parents were Democrats, but the Dem Party has gone insane. They support every sexual perversion ever developed, but they conspired to shut down free speech on the internet, they weaponized the federal bureaucracy and federal law enforcement against Catholics and Conservatives and anyone who was in D.C. on Jan. 6th. They engage in lawfare and hate EVERYTHING Trump does, simply because he does it... with no regard to if it is a good thing or a bad thing. They want men in women's locker rooms, and women's sports, they want to oppress my church and ban public displays of religion, while pushing drag queen story hour. This is NOT the party of JFK anymore... they are all about corruption and power. When the ancient Greeks said ""Those whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad""... they were talking about the Democratic Party. They are a wretched hive of scum and villany."
US:157163889,"The Democrats represent the hard working people of our country, not the rich who are always looking for tax cuts."
US:2242522,The Republican party has completely acquiesced to the far right anti democratic Trump regime.
US:173741443,I was a Republican for 50 years up until 2020. I still think they are the better party for supporting the economy but it is not the party I grew up with anymore.
US:133104171,"I am for womens rights, dei, science, defending the police, and I generally think at this point that Republicans don't understand what's going on in the country."
US:135484507,Because my family are republicans.
US:198213103,"I care about human rights, and I think the government has the duty to protect them. I care about inclusiveness and equity. I care about protecting the environment. I care about having social services that ensure people has basic needs met including access to food, housing, healthcare, and education."

US:4279004,Taxes
US:30467355,The values of the Democratic Party are a better match for my own values than other political parties.
US:28985634,"I am woke! I care about people, the environment, education, freedom and health."
US:108617303,Both parties are shit. Trump only ran as a Republican out of necessity.
US:193216061,The democrats are most in line with my views and concerns.
US:193179173,The Democratic Party is concerned with equity and providing help for the middle class and a safety net for Americans in need. The Republicans party has lost its focus on everyday Americans and seems only to care about billionaires. They are not following the Constitution and allowing the President to do illegal acts like deporting people without due process. Republicans are spineless weasels who are afraid to counter Trump.
US:154035825,do not want the government to control me and everything else
US:134388045,"Democrats support women’s rights, voting rights, reproductive rights, labor unions, environmental protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the rule of law. Republicans support tax cuts for billionaires, are not stopping Trump’s attacks on democracy, the courts, and the Constitution."
US:172502233,"The Republicans are generally more conservative and fiscally conservative. They also currently are more practical and logical in their thinking. I don't see Republicans generally throwing themselves into fits every time something doesn't go their way. There also are not riots, widespread protests or personal private property damages going on. Loads of bricks are not left for protesters to turn into projectiles, republicans behave like adults and conduct their business professionally most of the time. There may be ocasions when someone goes a bit off script but it's rare whereas democrats all spew fir the same propaganda lies and ugly insults over EVERY event regardless of whether it's real or imagined. Trumps speech for the State of the Union is a perfect example"
US:1587110,"I believe that while you should be able to help other people, you are ultimately responsible for yourself, your own decisions, your own financial choices and should not be dependent on others except during an emergency. I believe in the right shoes where the right to abortion is taken control. I believe women’s rights has been super imposed by trans rights. I am grateful to say at my age. I don’t have that much longer to live in the world that we have created the last four years. I can only hope President Trump will be allowed to do what he is trying to do."
US:39798792,"benefit all people, not just the rich"
US:188588475,"First and foremost: human rights. I believe that the government should NEVER have gained control over people’s rights, as we are seeing happen right now. This encompasses women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, POC rights, and immigration rights. Secondly, inflation and rising costs. Trump was talking about tariffs way before he was elected into office; we knew this was coming. Now, we are on the precipice of what seems like another depression, due to these tariffs. Thirdly, I was personally terrified of the Project 2025 goals and did not want an administration that was going to gut our system from the inside out."
US:1182350,They support the average American
US:173611957,"It's all a sham. It's no longer ""Republican"" vs ""Democrat."" It's ""the parties"" - i.e. the politicians vs. the rest of us -the average citizens. In D.C. the Democrats and Republicans serve only themselves. The differences between the parties no longer boil down to anything truly meaningful; the Democrats seem intent on destroying the whole of America and turning it into yet another Socialist/Communist shithole dictatorship. And the Republicans seem intent on feigning obliviousness in order to protect ""the system;"" a system purposefully designed to keep the general populace infuriated and fighting among ourselves while they grow fat off our tax dollars. Both parties essentially profit off our destruction and suffering. Look at every federal and state politician. Every one of them left office with a much higher net worth than they went in, and by a margin exponentially larger than their salary. All except one. Donald Trump is the only ""politician"" in over a century who actually LOST a significant portion of his net worth by being in office (about 1/3). That is a fine illustration of why the people voted for him: because unlike EVERY other person to ever hold office he is actually serving US. Not himself, not ""the system,"" not some trillionaire family pulling strings in a few dozen other countries. America first."
US:197466299,Too many politicians on both sides have been in office too long! They are out of touch and only work for themselves. We need term limits and need more laws or rules to keep representatives in check
US:2894373,I am not loyal to any party as neither party has the ability to do what is right for the country.
US:4512280,The democrats are evil and want illegals coming in are ok with abortion and all the things I don't agree with
US:106484935,No idea as I really do not know much about it at all.
US:2099289,There are only two choices and much more of their agenda aligns with my own. Everything Republicans stand for these days is repulsive.
US:35152742,I vote for the person who I believe would be the best person for the job whether D or R
US:203174233,I don't think either party are really in tune with the people. I don't see myself really represented in politics.
US:39359086,"Pro life, pro family, pro traditions, constitutionalist, freedom, pursuit of happiness."
US:2880304,They have proven to do the will of the people
US:40796458,The Democratic Party is the party of hate! They only care about power.
US:168293435,I believe in the freedom of choice. There is no republican party anymore only trumpites. I will never have any connection with them on any level. Many of the questions you asked I could not answer because I am on a total blackout of any political news because I am so distraught about the outcome of the election and destruction of our county by this administration
US:109210105,Basically because the Republican party went from conservative to fascist. And I want to be part of the group most likely to stop it.
US:867789,Agree more on the issues
US:147889159,"I am a Republican because they more closely align with my ideals and values. I could never align myself with a party that thinks it's okay to prosecute and jail their political opponents, try to censor free speech (ie Twitter files), openly celebrate assassination attempts on Presidents, push ""gender affirming care"" for minors (cutting off breasts and other parts), and to top it all off, allow the border to remain wide open, allowing estimates up to 20 million illegal aliens. They're also a party that is actively fighting to return an illegal alien who is a member of MS13. Where was that effort when people in our own country were flooded out of their homes, or their houses burned down in Maui or California wildfires? They are completely out of touch with working class America, and/or actively working against us."
US:1524032,I’m a fiscal republican with democratic social issues.
US:4172057,I don't have a liberal mindset like most Democrats
US:136490463,I don't favor what the republicans represent
US:184826007,"Because the democrats left me. I was one, and I will never again be one."
US:210769,It is inclusive and represents a majority of my values.
US:31903230,Exactly
US:183941241,Because Republicans care more about jobs and the economy and illegal immigration. Democrats care more about social issues
US:450771,Because Democrats represent democracy Republican are for the ones with more power money.
US:22678150,I'm not really sure at the moment
US:196449179,Be a Democrat? Now? You must be out of your mind!
US:2368335,Republicans actually worry about national security and the economic success if the middle class; Liberals just TALK about those issues!
US:137424539,I find democratic candidates mostly share my beliefs
US:191307891,Respect human rights
US:173394987,Because of what they do for congress.
US:1040733,Do not like either side neither do what is right for the people but what makes them money we should vote all independants in.
US:128639427,Their policies and aims coincide with mine.
US:203667,They know men are men and women are women and are for supporting the protection of women and kids and the security of the USA
US:181373543,Conversative beliefs
US:25712424,Government of for and by the people. Equality. Education. Science. Medicine.
US:35574005,I want to protect the wealth I have by reducing the size of the government and making sure our country is safe.
US:2541917,Mt mom didn’t raise me to hate
US:24849569,More liberal
US:24296028,Because I believe in facts
US:137212877,Because both parties have their own interests in hand not the people of the country but for themselves
US:28865908,The parties look out for their political alliances not the American people.
US:169013383,The Republican Party leans more to Conservatives.
US:4375822,Not sure just seems to align more
US:39435551,I agree with the Republican platform and I wish the Republicans in Congress would all band together to take a strong stand with Trump to codify his executive orders and fight against anything the insane democrats put forward.
US:151098033,because i believe in prolife
US:182686875,I feel that I fall close to the middle in my political beliefs. I think social issues are very important and I think that democrats support more programs that help everyone.
US:176867637,"So many reasons. They are for democracy, rule of law, abortion rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights, other civil rights, pro-environment, efforts to reduce climate change, efforts to reduce inequality, union support, separation of church and state Etc. etc."
US:3737489,"I wasn't always a republican but once I saw all the deception and all the lies the democrats can't help but spew, I will NEVER vote for them again, no matter what"
US:125395153,i think for myself
US:24948070,"I care about all people, not just reach ones."
US:101110507,More to my. way of thinking
US:118683655,They are more concerned with women's rights and healthcare reform. They also tend to fight more for the environment
US:34121735,See things from both sides.
US:179898215,"I agree with most of the party's platform. I am pro-Christian, pro-life, and pro-gun."
US:41029865,"I’m a Republican because they are (ostensibly) the party or small, limited government that is dedicated to free markets and free people. They protect the rights of the smallest minority - the individual and the rights of the most vulnerable among us (the unborn)."
US:132901419,Both parties are corrupt. George Washington warned about political parties.
US:40927400,Both parties are basically the same.
US:329920,Freedom and aligns with my values
US:206856767,Donald Trump sucks this time around. Patrick morrisey is a crook.
US:4680467,"Because I am ""for"" the people who make up the majority of the citizens of this country, not the few ultra-rich!"
US:101148325,"We care about the real American dream where anyone can get ahead, not just the rich. We cherish diversity, inclusion, love"
US:31805086,Because I don't agree with either side.
US:22195875,The party most of the same values as me
US:193461303,Because the Republicans are without morals or ethics. They talk a lot but their actions show them to be nothing but hypocrits. They only care about themselves and money. The love of money is the root of all evil. Money and power. They follow in the footsteps of evil.
US:202328,"I value life, the rule of law and believe in limiting government. That is obviously no longer the platform of the Democrat party- if it ever was."
US:152478693,Party’s are just a way to divide us into camps. Also campaign expenses are insane. We need campaign finance reform
US:137845639,N/A
US:3623801,Do more for the people of the United States.
US:102152019,Because of the people where we live are
US:743188,Because there is not a viable progressive party. And I know what you're thinking but the Green Party is a joke.
US:2548810,Because I believe in humanity and goodwill towards fellow human beings.
US:3089333,"I believe in working hard, making my way without government assistance or interference. Government should only be about public safety, roads and infrastructure, police and fire protection."
US:140205799,"I don't like most things about either party. They both fear monger, spread disinformation, talk a lot and do nothing."
US:100517137,Trump
US:4378680,I don’t believe in taking advantage of people who don’t know any better. I believe in freedom of choice and being equal
US:134730625,"I'm a Democrat because I'm a nicer person than the Republicans who are angry hostile people that act crazy and violent in our walls where I'm chill, laid back person all my life who enjoys life, goes shopping online, listening to music, singing, making money."
US:41243877,"At this point in time the Democratic Party is uber left, they like men in women’s sports, they like an open border, they coddle illegal immigrants, they push DEI, they allow criminals to get out without bail, and they push to allow schools to set aside parents’ wishes when it comes to curriculum and gender affirmation."
US:125956753,"I believe that Democrats are the lesser of two evils. I think that they tend to work in the best interest of the American people. I also think that they exercise democracy. For these reasons, I vote Democrat."
US:2885885,I'm patriotic.
US:23539821,n/a
US:39930423,"Because i believe that women can make decisions about their body, that taking care of our environment is important, that public school education is the backbone of our country, that our country should take care of its weakest people, that DEI is necessary, that immigrants need a pathway to citizenship, that guns need to be better regulated, that free speech belongs to everyone, and that Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our country and to democracy."
US:112250555,They are only slightly better then the opposition
US:32203588,It's best
US:192471837,I believe it is essential for government to protect and defend the poor and the marginalized.
US:183414843,They are inclusive and believe in letting people make their own decisions. They care about all people and want to make their own decisions world a better place.
US:168937605,If I had to pick between the two I'd say Republican because I believe with them more often.
US:147272223,Democrats are more kind to one another and are more representative of my values.
US:135284395,I believe in compassionate governance
US:123091793,I don't really know if I'm a republican or not. I might lean more libertarian. But I know I'm not a democrat. At least not like the current democrats. They seem to me to be completely evil at this point. I want small a government.
US:1102136,freedom
US:1359371,"I believe the Constitution should be followed as written. Government must provide for defense, and public safety first and foremost. The federal government should be run by elected officials and not bureaucrats. Our system has become upside down with the federal government trying to manage responsibilities the states have like Education. I see the Republicans as the best hope for a reset that will allow our republic to flourish as the founders intended."
US:943741,Democrats are not so limiting in their thinking
US:189274897,It is a false choice
US:158960125,I vote for the person and policies rather than for a party.
US:102839849,We share the same views of what the people want and need for this country
US:195262067,"Republican values are at the core of morality and decency in this country. While democrats sink into the depths of depravity and insanity, Republicans hold fast to maintaining a strong country with its conservative values."
US:41032485,"The values of the Democratic party most closely match my own. Especially in the past 10 years. I was not previously a strongly partisan person and I probably even have some conservative views, but the Republican party is just a nativist, sadistic, and increasingly dumb cult of personality now."
US:156842107,"I believe both parties have sound ideas and ridiculous ideas. If we take the good ideas from each side and work together, the country wins."
US:166371393,Why do we have a felon for a president. Why don't they ban plastic with
US:124080699,I believe in freedoms and am pro life

US:130708761,I believe people are inherently good
US:200686411,"I believe in capitolism, not socialism, closed borders, reduction of DEI, no taxes on social security or tips, and a stroger military force."

US:175587291,The party is more pro non-rich people than the GOP.
US:165842269,I believe in a small efficient government

US:170337549,"The alternative is horrible (now, though it wasn't always that way)"

US:4171766,Democrats are for everything I am against.

US:183136913,"I believe in Medicare For All, saving Medicare and Social Security."
US:2027790,Most of their policies are more towards putting people first than Republican policies. Even when they go about it the wrong way.
US:173018317,Civil rights
US:181647293,"The GOP is self-serving, corrupt and punative. There are democrat leaders who posess the same qualities, but they have not made persecution of minorities the core of their national platform."
US:133828413,smaller govt. less taxation.
US:202933645,Both parties can be rather disappointing.
US:135045889,They don’t give everything away
US:149933517,Because politics don’t make sense to me.
US:3074022,Because Democrats CLEARLY hate America and want to change it into an open country that has no rule of law.
US:204599389,Believe in the constitution and declaration of independence. We're all man a created equal.

US:184924473,Neither.

US:3646267,"They believe in the separation of the three branches of government, in freedom of speech and that all people were created equal."
US:126321,"I am a Democrat because Trump's extremist and sectarian Republicans must be stopped; besides, Democrats bring more stability to the country."
US:172262633,The left has gone too far left and is out of touch with most citizens. I also support the right to defend myself. The left hasn't given a good summary of their agenda or the things they'd change in quite some time.
US:172097381,To tell you the truth I don’t know why I am a Democrat. I don’t want to change to Republican. I am seriously considering changing to independent. There is no one in government right now that I care for. There is so much hate and bitterness.
US:978286,They are slightly less batshit crazy...
US:36210181,"I used to be a democrat, but changed my party 20 yrs. ago. I felt the Dm. party was leaning too far to the left and couldn't follow their platforms. The Republicans are the more rational party now."
US:25254174,"Because I for the poor, innocent, and minority."
US:28753509,I am more Libeterian
US:124058753,"Because Trump most closely aligns with my political views. MAGA Republicans are the future, the closet Democrat RINOS are going extinct. America first is back, thank goodness."

US:35453027,"Because I believe in diversity, equity and inclusion."
US:38142181,I believe that the Republican party has values and beliefs that are very similar to my own. I do not agree with DEI as I am a Christian. I feel as though the democratic party tries to push this and other policies I do not agree with on me.
US:2483062,they oppose donald trump; they value democracy

US:188088047,My parents was Democrat
US:185678293,"I was (mostly) a Republican all my life until 2015 when Trump ran for office. He was obviously unsuitable to me, so I voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. Since then the Republican party has only gotten more extreme and needs to be voted out for a reset."
US:40794119,Because I’m not liberal. I don’t like the way our schools are headed. I believe in 2 genders! Men shouldn’t use women’s restrooms and vice versa. I’d love to see jobs ( good jobs) brought back to America. I’d love to see parents have real rights when it comes to their children. I also believe that our country needs protected.

US:42512242,Better values
US:2126109,I am more conservative leaning

There are no republicans in office standing up for what is right against trump. not following the constitution""There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain"" Liz Cheney"
US:23990824,I think they care about people more
US:186818569,I did a great choice
US:186901393,"I believe that government’s first responsibility is to keep our nation and its people safe and work for measures that offer economic well-being of our country. Republicans believe in power through a strong military. They support closing our borders to illegals who being drugs and crime into our country. They support and protect women by stopping biological makes from completing in sports and going into girls locker rooms. They support energy independence by supporting the clean development of our oil, coal and gas reserves. They place value on merit in hiring and college enrollments, while supporting school choice to enable all students to have access to a good education."
US:178791613,I believe in small government.
US:598524,"Fiscal conservative, social progressive. Federal govt should control military, national security, world affairs. Education, healthcare, and social programs should be controlled by the state's."
US:39644479,idk
US:127903285,Because I cant afford to be a republican.

US:184097507,"I have always been a republican. They are the ""common sense"" party. They want what is better for Americas."
US:191010417,Democratic values go way too far left for me.
US:183937347,I align more closely with their policies and ideals
US:28000767,"Because the values they tend to align with are closer to mind. For example, I don't believe an abortion except an extreme circumstances, and I blame immigration should be decreased or at least illegal aliens dealt with."
US:40941474,Because they have much better policies overall
US:122636967,Because the majority of Republicans are racist
US:2965939,I am 87 years old and have voted approximately 60% democratic over my lifetime. The party has become too liberal for me now and I would not vote for a democrat at this time
US:804937,Democrats revere logic and democracy. Republicans (at least current Republicans) revere power.
US:25583083,More choices on that side
US:137375565,not sure
US:102088179,I feel they have similar thoughts and value as I do.
US:1579252,The Republican at least puts forth ideas and will debate them. ALL of the Democrats in Washington (elected reps and the bureaucracy) have lost touch with reality.
US:862947,"I am very conservative, and in my entire voting years, I have never seen a conservative democrat."
US:36996550,Because neither group has the policy in place yet to address all the issues that are affecting the country

US:157910241,that's what my parents were
US:40205511,"There was a time when I sided and voted Republican. Because of the weakness and mindless support of current idiot in the White house, It will be years before I ever vote Republican again. I vote for the person not the party, for over a decade I have been voting Democratic. I have not trusted a Republican in years."
US:40858605,"I don't biologically believe in a lot of the propaganda they're pushing, such as boys can become girls, etc. They rate of the detransitioning when they got older, or worse, is a documented fact. I also believe that babies are human beings from conception. They have their own set of DNA, different from the mother or father. And allowing a baby to die after he/she survived a partial birth abortion is absolutely murder in the first degree. I could go on and on, but it's late and I'm exhausted."
US:793207,Because they actually give a damn about people. Although they lack the balls to stand up to the Republicans
US:38116937,"Republicans are for the people, they have always been for all the people. Whether you are rich, poor, White, black, man or woman. I'm proud to be a republican, they always try to stand with the people and bring you up, not hold you down."

US:39463285,The Democrats are far to liberal for my beliefs and morale standing.
US:1130515,Republicans should uphold conservative ideals. Conserving the Constitution. The Constitution intended to have limited government. The federal government has there hands in everything.

US:2129945,To preserve the ideals of the Constitution
US:184196597,Both parties support elites. We should abolish parties and factionalism through the Venetian Ballot.
US:181010171,"Because the Democratic Party actually *cares* about all of the people - not just the WEALTHY, and they have practical, results-oriented ideas for governing. All other political parties are either very draconian or too idealistic to be considered practical."

US:139878371,"Since I am not able to become actively involved in the administration and operation of a party, I am not comfortable with the idea of considering myself a ""member"" of any party. If I did, then that would interfere with my ability to assess both parties in an unbiased way."

US:42894974,I am aligned largely to the values of the party

US:177145199,I lean more towards the Republican party because the values of the Republicans are more closely aligned with my values.
US:188253589,"I value common sense policies. Being forced to take the COVID shot to stay employed really woke me up. I was not a follower of politics until 2020/2021. The open border, rise in crime, the decline of California, the education in public schools, the cover up of a President's mental decline, just to name a few, these were all extreme wake up calls for me. Also the legal actions against Trump from the Biden White House was HUGE! Rules for thee but not for me! Biden's son committed so many crimes and got away with all of them. This is not a fair characteristic of our justice system. So, I am a republican because, while it is not a perfect party, it has better morals and more common sense policies that align with my thinking."
US:164858385,I believe in equality for all. I'm for basic human rights over law and order. I'm for a women's right to choose. I'm for freedom to practice whatever religion you wish or none at all.

US:206753361,"Because the Trump administration has taken the Republican party so far right that it's basically become a FASCIST DICTATORSHIP. Nobody can even disagree with him without punishment, he's widened the wealth gap tremendously, and even just the way he speaks sounds like Hitler!"

US:33912753,We have been democratic nation for a very long time and democrats spend spend spend. Democrats try to undermine the republican party so nothing can get accomplished. They are cry babies
US:27584,"At one point the Democratic Party stood for values like equality, personal rights, and taxing the wealthy in order to build a better world for everyone else. On a federal level they have entirely abandoned any of these commitments (and on the state level they are pretty meh about them). But we live in a fucked up FPTP system, and even though Democratic leaders are all enthusiastically anti-immigrant/pro-genocide/pro-capitalism-destroying-the-world, my feeling is that many people in the Democratic base are still normal humans with functioning senses of morality and empathy."
US:39274448,"I think the party system should end. It's domintaed by money, and special interests that the donors support. Elected officials should support what is good for the country, as a whole, not what the PACs want"
US:37748276,"I believe in improving the general social welfare. I support education, abortion, universal healthcare, unions, immigrants, separation of church and state, ACLU, SPLC, eqaul rights, rule of law, no kings, the wealthy should pay their fair share, no one is above the law ever."
US:3259768,"They are more for the common people, not the rich!"
US:43279303,They are for helping Americans.
US:153555185,"Because the GOP left people like me behind. I am pro-choice, I support all civil rights (LGTBQ+, DEI, Black, Hispanic, etc.) I am well educated, wealthy, and prefer politicians who work across party lines to get things done. Cruelty, divisiveness, ignorance, fascism, and racism should have no place in politics, and tet here we are with MAGA."
US:203465795,Cause it’s not republicans and there’s no other options
US:1589541,"Because they have been the modern party for voting rights ,civil rights for women and minorities, protecting the environment, respecters of data/evidence in science--true heirs of our Enlightment forefathers and foremothers--concern for the poor, the food insecure, public education, protectors of journalists and the Constitution."
US:41833924,it is the only party protecting the Constitution and protecting the needs of its citizens

US:2016267,They’re my people!
US:139267251,I am a conservative individual which believes in smaller government.
US:4039913,My mother was a Republican and she always voted. I guess that's why I'm Republican
US:182906227,Right now the Democratic party is completely untrustworthy and the Republican party is still working on issues and don't know whether to trust if they're doing the right things for American people or strategizing to help themselves out in the future while giving everyone else false hope with their promises
US:151170615,"I am of the belief of the separation of church a d state. I believe everyone has a right to vote and there shouldn't be so many hoops to jump through or blocks to jump over. I believe the government should be helping the elderly, disabled, poor, etc. We live in a society not on individual islands. The right to choose to have an abortion or not. Everyone getting health care, etc. A person can only go so far in lifting themselves up, sometimes they need a hand up as well."
US:29991845,The Democrat party failed in 2024 to have a legitimate presidential primary. The Republican Party has failed to fight corruption and lack credibility.

US:1150578,not really sure....but I think they our best interest
US:34830981,Neither party seems to align with my political views.
US:533234,"neither party represents us people. Democrats are too timid and incompetent. Republicans are like communists - they do not respect the rule of law, destroying American democracy."
US:102539451,I really dont side with either party. I think we say some nice things about what our goals are or what's really happening but they aren't necessarily true
US:2726404,to get rid of the rino's and make the party stronger
US:113651245,Because they support our immigrant comunity
US:27575224,In the middle since some have good points and bad points.
US:4626905,"I like to vote for the best candidate, not along party lines. I prefer non-incumbents to incumbents who have already had their chance and probably pissed me off."
US:42870790,At first I went Democrat because I liked the person running. But I went a different way when President Bush ran because I believed in him. If he was running I would vote for him again. I liked President Biden but I noticed he was not all there at the end. But Pamela Harris I sort of liked her but I just didn't like the way she was thinking. Too much for the welfare and immigrants giving like she had a bag of candy. Sorry but everyone has to suffer and learn how to work. Our generation now a day's want everything free. Babysitting for instance work nights leave your children with your husband or boyfriend. But they get free Babysitting so why suffer. Men women staying home and getting free welfare funds. Whats wrong with one of them working. Then you have immigrants coming just to suck out of our system. They have spouse's but they go to the system as single parent. But they all live together driving around in new vehicles and living the good life. While the rest of us watch how good they have it. And sucking up all the programs they can.
US:144847367,Because the conservatives are crazy.
US:2391749,Democrats are bat-shit crazy.
US:32468116,I agree with almost all of the republican policies
US:40796317,"Because we are the party of the working class, unions, equality, following and protecting the Constitution and rule of law. We would Never allow a Democratic president to pull the illegal stuff Trump is pulling."
US:175184605,I am pro choice and don't want any imbecile telling me what to do. I'm pro health care for all and for the environment.
US:139744839,"Why? I agree with democrats on MOST issues. However on SOME issues democrats have lost me on. Like we NEED the wall. We do NOT ... NEED... mass migration. Also we don't need gun control. It's a shame, nearly every single other issue I vote democrat but enough is enough. Also, it's good the US is buying Bitcoin. Democrats should get on board with this, drop gun control and the desire to have nearly open borders and America and they'll do much better in the polls. And yes they were eating the cats and dogs there were videos online and I saw them do it."
US:2141009,I disagree with Republicans on nearly every issue
US:161514903,I do not care for the beliefs of either one.

US:2749435,I believe in small government and self determination.
US:3362030,"Democrats give consideration to the average citizen, and work to include all, regardless of station in life. They fight to make sure all have a chance to participate in daily life."
US:169649039,I agree with the Republican agenda. They have the same goals as I do in my life.
US:954020,Democrats work to understand the issues that effect all types of regular people and the systems that can help or hurt them. They utilize government for the betterment of society.
US:4313386,"I identify more with the working class and favor programs that assist people who need it, not rich politicians and business honchos, who always have loop holes and perks available to them at the expense of the poor and middle class."
US:165453519,I vote with my wallet and never with my heart
US:39745190,So I can maintain rights and freedoms.
US:354519,The Democratic Party aligns with my values more closely than the Republican Party does.
US:184006701,"I’m pro-life. Pro family. Pro church. Want to protect freedom of speech and gun rights. I support our military! Pro hard work, if you want something work for it. Exhausted with the left endlessly finding something to be upset about. Tired of the complaining, the ranting, the riots."
US:29696175,I think it's time to end CORRUPTION in government

US:193947347,They're the party that aligns most with my views
US:773611,Because Democrats tend to care about people's welfare
US:38453039,I can't get on board with the far left loonies. It seems like common sense has gone out the windows and there are too many undereducated liberal leftists who have become unhinged and dangerous. I'm also interested in protecting the rights of natal women and I feel that democrats have perverted the meaning of what a woman is
US:183158553,"Generally, Republicans act to reduce the size and power of the federal bureaucracy, promote individual liberty and free markets, reduce the tax and regulations burdens, keep a strong military and foreign policy, enforce laws to secure borders as well as communities."
US:1170211,Democrats recognize the role of government to protect the vulnerable and needy rather than corporate interests.
US:35807723,Because i do not believe in one side over the other i like some of one party and some of the other party
US:2295035,"The Republlicans are acting like lemmings, following Trump blindly so he won’t “hurt” them, and the Democrats tend to spend too much."
US:125650549,Because the democrats are a bunch of nut jobs
US:137179531,"Honestly, when I was first deciding if I was going to register as a republican or democrat, I had two main reasons that ultimately caused me to choose republican....the first one being that at that particular time in my life, I found the word democrat to sound mean, lol. And of course, the other reason, as I would say is the same as a lot of individuals who are first deciding between the two, is that the majority of my family were Republicans."
US:182221299,Both parties are corrupted by money and power they all should be in prison
US:1024328,Because I can see both sides have a mission
US:179297319,I love Obama ♥️ Bernie Sanders I HATE Trump
US:45567065,"I am pro life, traditional marriage only and fiscally conservative."
US:26993569,Because Democrats are for the middle-class people
US:184499569,you have more freedom to be who you are
US:42722585,Because I’m not an old white senile fascist.
US:2895485,"Because the republican party stands for freedom of speach, law and order, strong military, believes in naming judicial candidates that follows the constitution, has actually combat fraud and waste in government, and has a president that that believes in truth in goverment and brings to a reality the promises made, and prefers to have peace with other nations."
US:185311857,More free thinking
US:1363740,They represent my view more
US:165153229,They are for the middle class
US:1134704,"Prefer lower taxes, smaller government and self reliance with a safety net for people not a handout."
US:3643828,The democrats have lost their minds and are extremely condescending.
US:775068,"The Dems have moved so far left, they should be outlawed. Everyone in their party are supposed to be in lockstep. Biden or whoever was in charge were so far off the 'reservation' I didn't feel I was in the US."
US:34279308,The democratic party is more aligned with the will of the people. Neither party is good so I go with the lesser evil.
US:125176809,"I am a champion of free speech, the 2nd amendment, religious freedom, parental rights, smaller government, conservative fiscal policies and strong immigration laws and follow through."
US:4719094,because i don't hate america
US:41363939,"gun rights, pro-life, economic issues"
US:1957478,"I am for smaller government, anti-illegal aliens, anti-crime, anti-government waste and abuse."
US:134096657,they both have things I like and dislike
US:40574595,We place too much importance on what title or labels we think we are under and not on what really affects our quality of life. Most Americans do not understand what a republican is or what they really stand for. Government and those who find power in dividing us are on both sides.
US:1624410,I am a moderate individual that likes the best of the 2 parties.
US:40598239,"I believe in Freedom, and everyone pulling their own weight."

US:1568534,"I believe in true freedoms like the freedom to be your true self, love who you want, identify as you want. Freedom over your own body. Republicans believe in hypocritical freedoms that align with their narratives."
US:255134,Both parties have migrated to extreme positions that are counterproductive and ridiculous -- can't take either side seriously.
US:4373274,some of the issues aline with mine
US:193869163,Why? So you can narc me out to peter thiel?
US:1583516,"I believe in law and order, secure borders, and cutting government spending on unnecessary programs."
US:181110149,The value of a true republican alines with what I value in life
US:206117197,Qualified people
US:4323097,I don't want to be associated with either party at the moment. They all need improvements.

US:205292937,I just don't like the way the government has been in a while
US:41794147,They are not liberal Democrats
US:22787818,"I am very liberal, usually more so than the Democratic party, but much closer to them than the Republicans."
US:29431643,"Magas and their republican enablers are cruel, fascistic idiots."
US:116946133,I am much closer to the Democratic Party because our values align on more issues than the Republican Party and these issues are of more importance to me. We are closer together on the political spectrum than the opposition.
US:2281921,I’d be too embarrassed to be a Rebublican.
US:4292071,I don't like Republicans stand on important issues
US:180981061,I just feel it's the correct way of life

US:3021358,closer to my views especally on the border
US:138970111,"We are more morally evolved. We care about all people (or do in theory; this party has failed in curbing influence peddling on BOTH sides of the aisle.) Historically, Democrats fought for rights, benefits and protections for the working class. We need to focus on the “radical middle.”"
US:197384037,Because I Have a Brain
US:167727741,"While there are Republican views that I agree with, there are more that make sense with the Democrats"
US:181586965,"Because I’m in line with more Republican policies,views, and values."

US:41189471,I care about others.. our job in life is to help people
US:109058679,I don't follow the party but the candidate
US:3367709,"I’m quite disgusted by both parties. I think people need to take responsibility for their own financial wellness and not expect the government to bail them out or pay for things they can’t afford. The gap between the haves and the have nots is widening and salaries are not keeping up with rising costs. As a hard working single American who uses coupons and shops bargain brands, rarely eats out, and doesn’t go on vacation I can barely afford to keep a roof over my head and eat twice a day while working full time. It’s sad that I work really hard for the basics and can’t even afford to drive 2 hours to the beach for the day let alone afford an overnight stay."
US:169986233,not sure
US:180652243,I never was until trump
US:31271192,More aligned with my interests
US:153101,Because I value common sense. Republicans most closely align with my values. Exactly why I voted for them to represent me in government. The public cannot run the government so we must vote for whom we believe will work the best for us! And it certainly would not be the crime ridden Democrats. I want to see them (Democrats) held accountable and illegitimate funds returned to over taxed Americans with said criminals punished for their crimes. Doge will find them!
US:127192065,I feel democrats are more for the working people and republicans are for the rich
US:1290894,"Both have some good and bad qualities. Both make good and bad decisions. I look at the decisions made, not the party behind same."

US:40138528,Almost all of the important economic and social policies put into law have been past by the Democratic Party.

I'm a Democrat because I believe in democracy. In the past, you could be a Republican and believe in democracy, but as Republican leaders grow more openly immoral and corrupt with each passing day, it's difficult to associate them with freedom, and it's difficult to associate them with the average Americans they claim to serve."
US:175565353,Small government

US:840667,"I have conservative fiscal views, but neither political party does. Republicans are a tax cut and spend party, which is fiscally irresponsible. Democrats are a tax and spend party, which is more responsible than the republicans, but still sub-optimal. Socially, my positions are between the parties. I do not believe government should intrude into the bedrooms of citizens (republicans seemingly want to know what types of sex people have and outlaw some forms of it), but I do believe in a law abiding society, which democrats equivocate over. I believe in conservation and the environment (which used to be a conservative cause [conserve is the root word of conservative and conservation], but is now a liberal cause. In sum, I'm in between the parties and feel aligned with neither."

US:119339901,"I agree more with traditional Republican beliefs, but not all. I am pro choice, but want gun control. I want to reduce the amount of freebies and government spending, but want the wealthy to not have so many shortcuts around taxes. I believe in climate change and want to control illegal immigration. I don't like the idea of having to align with a party where I disagree with so many of their policies.
