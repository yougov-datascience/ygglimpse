The gun laws they keep proposing make it harder for me to get a weapon or ammunition to defend myself while they cry to defund the police so I can be defenseless and the bar keeps getting lowered in areas such as faith and abortion, the government in the hands of the left was leaning towards totalitarianism and I stopped recognizing my country anymore as they weakened our military and opened our borders and then told me there's more than two genders and our fucking sex was assigned at birth and we could change it at will contrary to the science they propose to support. That's why I am a registered republican and I consider myself a conservative because the few values I share with the liberals are not even considered left leaning any longer.

If life is one of those rights – that means health. that means every American deserves to be able to eat, to have secure shelter, and be able to take care of their body on the most basic levels. Liberty requires that you feel able to do things. This is not permission. This is ability. Liberty doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want, but it does mean you can discuss and have the opportunity to explore options and situations. If you transgress others' liberty, that is an infringement of their rights. With liberty you are not punished for thoughts or expressions, nor are you forced to accept others thoughts or expressions. Once your life and health are guaranteed, and your ability for free thought are guaranteed, you get the ability to pursue happiness. This is an individual thing. I believe that while the Democratic Party is not great at this, they understand that collective good – results in individual freedom. The whole point of government should be collective good, not selective control.   it's where I was born & raised, family here"

Ever since Donald Trump ran for president in 2015, Republicans are unable or incapable of standing up for their constituents, even when Mr Trump's policies are not in their constituents' best interest. Plus, I don't trust any Republican, especially Donald Trump, after how the attack on the capitol played out.

This is why I've had to move for the past 4 times. Every time blacks become greater than 10-15% of the population, everything goes to shit and it becomes a violent area.
