US:187445237,"I've watched Joe Biden during his entire political career. He was a plagiarist, liar & a con man. He should be behind bars. Barack Obama (whom I voted for) & misused billions of tax dollars to fund violent Islamic groups through USAID. Then Hillary Clinton piled with the missing 35,000 emails and her creation of the Steele dossier (& 24 strangley 'unalived' people) drove me away from the Democrat Party forever. The DNC cannot be trusted for the remainder of my lifetime. They protest for criminal illegal alien gang members on our tax money, And not a single member of the Democrat Party can correctly quote two full sentences from ANY PART of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. We should not elect people from that last category."
US:172544273,I was noticing the Democrats were taking this country in the wrong direction and not working towards the American people. We finally have an administration that is working for America and not other countries and illegal aliens
US:193067365,The Democratic Party proved themselves to be untrustworthy.

US:189873961,"I believe Republicans do the right thing for the country, I don't believe in freebies to people who CAN WORK but choose not to. Tax oayers like me should not have to pay for the lazy who live off of the government."
US:185768509,"Republicans are for common sense and for 80% of what people want, Democrats are for stupid policies and only for 20% of what people want"

US:171211981,"I discovered the democrats are all liars who will say anything to get a vote. They never keep their promises, and never will. They are the party of Slavery, the KKK, Jim Crow, and all new slavery schemes like welfare."
US:171770213,I watched the GOP disintegrate into racism and idiotic decisions about the economy
US:39476131,Because GOP are closed minded and nasty. They pretend to be about freedom while they are standing on your throat. They are all about lip service and not in what they practice

US:183010911,Hearing the discussions of the Republicans and Democrats and the differences between the two I lean more toward the Democrats .
US:28811090,I Felt they Had the Right Ideas Not Giving away our Tax Money and Driving up Inflation!
US:29698917,"Democrats rely on objective reality, pursue the common good for all people, play by the rules, stand up for the common man, pursue more effective budget and tax policies, reduce the budget deficit in years when they are in power, are willing to raise taxes when needed, enact and protect social programs and policies that benefit all the people; protect the environment, support our veterans, protect the power and dignity of public service and public offices, support family farms and agriculture generally.

US:35161517,Democrats are for the people and have made the right decisions for the people and what I believe is right. They believe in freedom for ALL not just the view. They believe in uplifting the populace not keeping us ignorant. I could go on and on. I doubt I would ever vote Republican.

US:41171744,Because Republicans are trustworthy and genuine

US:4541450,Jesus said his kingdom is not part of this world neither is mine
US:4172882,I have been very fortunate in my life and I want those less fortunate to have the same opportunities that I've had. I want clean air and water. I want peace. I want all children to have the chance to get a good education. I think health care is a human right.

US:3220182,I hold most of the same values with the Democrat's platform.
US:23451541,"When the Republican party writ large got behind a lie to get us into a needless war in Iraq, smearing the people who were exercising their right to object. It was clear that there was one party that was not committted to being honest with the people, but rather maintaining their grip on power regardless of the cost. This has only become worse."
US:633394,"My best Friend who still is was a staunch Democrat. After lots of discussions I came to the conclusion that the Democratic Party was for helping the middle and lower class in important areas like health care, supporting unions and higher wages, protecting Social Security and Medicare, protecting the environment, protecting our Constitution and the Rule of Law and many other issues. I realized that the Republicans were all about tax breaks to the richest one percent and stood on the opposite side of the Democratic issues I just listed. I do not understand why people are voting Republican which in my mind is voting against one's own interest."

US:43317449,"That was a long time ago and I can't remember that far back. If I were deciding today it would be by default as the only other choice that is relevant would be democrat and even the thoughts of being a democrat is repulsive, sickening, disgusting and worse."
US:2760874,both parties have gotten too extreme and a failing to find middle ground to create an atmosphere of cooperation. The majority of both sides are busy throwing barbs and promoting extreme ideas

US:175254075,"There are several reasons. As a young adult I started to notice racism and misogyny and that the majority of the perpetrators were conservative/Republican. When affirmative action was implemented I saw how furious it made my father (a republican) of course my mother was all for it she worked full-time at the post office. When I went to University, expanding my mind to a more whole word view it reinforced in me how important our civil rights are."

US:31203933,"In 2016, when Trump became the Republican candidate, our whole family took a look at what the Republican Party had become and how we had been deceived for decades. We realized that our beliefs more closely aligned with the Democratic Party. Ethics, morals, honesty, and integrity were important to us and were demonstrated by the Democrats. As a result, every one of us switched parties. After opening our eyes and switching parties, we saw how terrifying the prospect of Trump being in charge would be. Quite a few of our fears came true, but democracy stood firm and we escaped scathed but not completely broken. Unfortunately, the Republican Party had become the Cult of Trump. Good people became brainwashed and dangerous. Biden attempted to repair the damage caused by Trump’s first term. We are actually stymied by the fact that Trump is leading the country again and completely destroying it. The rest of our nightmares are coming true and nobody seems to be able or gutsy enough to stop it."
US:187857009,They are not as adept at buy votes with my taxes as democrats

US:25413921,"The Democrats have always proclaimed to be the party of the working class, and I have always been part of that class. It would be stupid to vote differently. Unfortunately, they are so far out of touch with how the rest of us live that it barely makes any difference. Bernie Sanders gets it and he should’ve been nominated over Hilary. I vote blue because it’s the only viable choice. I want to vote for independent candidates but cannot because it is the same as throwing away my vote because of our stupid two party voting system."
US:179679629,I stand for most of the same believes
US:46332279,"Because Donald Trump/the MAGA cult/right wingers are a huge threat to America right now. They have also hijacked and taken over the Republican party. Since we’re a two-party country at the moment, the only organization that can take out the R party/MAGA and save us from King Trump is the Dem party"
US:2362919,because both parties are in my opinion the same party just at different ends of it.

US:173086831,It is right
US:173581789,Previous to 2016 I was a no political party registered voter. When Donald Trump decided to run I switched to Democrat to show that Arizona was not a purely red state.
US:41787297,Because republicans don’t care for people like me

US:715480,"in general, both parties are more concerned about retaining political power than needs of country and citizens"
US:3301322,"I don't believe anyone should vote according to what the party feels is the right candidate. Do your own research as to what each candidates platform is, and make the decision based on that"
US:141621219,"They lie and they are all about money and keeping money to them. They don't care about us low income people and families not being able to provide for their families and so many becoming homeless because they can't afford rent, bills, food."
US:3274215,They both have mostly the same priorities. They both favor more participation in wars and more government control over people's lives.
US:142478193,"Grew up GOP, but decided they had become anti-science and anti-fact, and dealt mainly in propaganda"
US:132432035,"I was a republican at 18. I stayed that way until I got fed up with Republican lies -- like saying Barrack Obama voted ""present"" most of the time as a senator, implying that is a nothing vote. It is a meaningful vote, and it made me angry they tried to mislead me. I switched to Democrat. voted for Barrack. He escorted people out of Yellowstone, he forced through the Obamacare (illegally), he pitted blacks against whites. Moreover, I had switched to maintstream media, and the OBVIOUS and AGGREGIOUS lies they told daily dwarfed those presented by the republicans. It became apparent that the republicans were, by far, the lesser of two evils. Sadly, this disparity has become an unsurmountable chasm by now. The Democrats are actively trying to subvert the constitution and the democracy, all while accusing the republicans of doing it. It is sick and evil."
US:28810803,Because I don’t want my political and moral thinking dictated by a party
US:179341765,Good for business
US:30591240,Followed my fathers opinion as self employed worker.

US:127495525,the elected should be a mixture of all parties. not just one.
US:201031447,I decide i am a Democrat because they are more sympathetic to the plight of their constituents. The Democratic party is always on the side of the poor.
US:39910030,liked the policies that impose
US:1192423,they're closer to my moderate views at this time
US:2771319,I just couldn't support the direction the Republican party was going at that time and ever since they have given more benefits to the rich and wealthy in our country instead of the middle and lower classes. They have evolved into the benefactors of the wealthy and corporations.
US:40728298,because Democrats are greedy dishonest idiots.
US:40964749,I believe in fairness and democracy. Trump and the Republican Party have destroyed this country.

US:1240764,I was registered as an Independent. I really wanted to vote in the Primaries and knew that I had to be a registered democrat or republican in order to vote in the primaries.
US:41180736,Because republicans are now authoritarians
US:1242473,It is a party for and of the people!?
US:139218423,"In high school, they basically taught that the Democratic party was more modern and more for letting people do whatever they want with their lives with minimal gvnt intervention- which in theory sounds great. Who wouldn't want the freedom to make their own choices? When I was in college, I remember one of my professors asking if abortion was right or wrong. I answered that it's fine because the baby in the womb doesnt have consciousness and they dont know whats going on, so to set the pregnant woman up for a good life, it was acceptable. This was what we were programmed in school to believe - you can't have a baby and be successful. I was so ignorant. In my 20s, I learned about abortions and what they actually were, and that they stole the life of a person with unique code of DNA. Babies do have consciousness pre-birth and that is shown by their reactivity in the belly and their playfullness pre-birth. Looking back, it seemed like being a young democrat was the cool thing to do and showed to be more open minded. This was back when gays marrying was a huge thing. I thought that the gvnt should mind their own business about who wants to marry who so that was the leading decision for me. I thought the people should have freedom of choice with their own bodies, which I was not educated on. I still believe the gays should be able to marry, but the way things have been progressing with society regarding this trans stuff, whoever said it was a slippery slope was totally correct. I feel as if the democratic party preys on young people and convinces them to side with them with a common-sense kind of approach, although it is incredibly misleading. After reflecting on what i think is important to me and what aligns with my values, the Republican party definitely resonated more with me."
US:1382468,They align more with my political & social values
US:205180495,I share values with the republican
US:24918332,both sides have flaws

US:40790377,"I was in first grade and did not want Jimmy Carter to win. I believed then and now we teach people to fish, we don't give out the fish."
US:109981989,Because the Democrats pushed a woke agenda
US:158637221,They aligned more with my beliefs of what the government should do for the people. I have always paid my taxes and feel I should be represented in Washington D.C.
US:1088813,"I have always believed that the Republican Party is the Party of Big Business. It is out of touch with the public. I believe that government should he responsive to the people’s needs and not to a select few. The Democratic Party has always stood for middle America, the poor, children, the elderly and the sick. It is the reason I am a Democratic."
US:986543,Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. This bond is being strained by the rise of the Uniparty in DC.

US:1436258,"Noy sure, made no difference"
US:1851770,More shared values
US:106331331,Democrats are for thec people
US:191976941,Neither side gives a rat's ass about the Citizen - it is all power and money
US:3348464,they had the same fauls
US:41485109,Because I read what they believed in and how they stood for America and then I read about the Democrats and what they believed in and I decided that I was more like the Republicans so that is how I saw it.
US:3183908,"Because Democrats are inclusive, fight for civil liberties, and generally have ordinary people's best interests at heart verses the Republicans who put the rich and corporations ahead of ordinary people."
US:1338750,Same reason
US:163763461,They are both corrupt and not serving the people

US:133816539,I saw the weakness J Carter showed the world and decided I'd never allow myself to be that way

US:35437871,I don’t decide on party platform but individual candidates.

US:134213293,"I was always generally fiscally closer, and Biden's social policy reforms pushed me the rest"

US:3780090,just felt that way
US:144891219,The Republicans are not into what the people want
US:3056112,"I became a Democrat because of the policies and programs supported by democrats. Citizens are given support and programs while Republicans appear to support business, sometimes at the expense of citizens. Democrats are kinder to people."

US:39061102,My values align more with conservative views

US:124403407,No com
US:1607245,I don't think either party is in touch or cares about what the American people are struggling with. All politicians have their own agenda which is why we rarely see change for the good of the people - look at how low the federal minimum wage is for one example
US:1100655,The way I was raised.
US:195202907,I agreed with their economic policies
US:1801606,The align more closely with my base feelings. That is not to say I agree with the Republican party 100%

US:27341118,"The Republicans are the only party that works for America. Democrats are a joke, lie, cheat, steal and are insane."

US:1059224,I realized that republicans have more to offer regular people
US:160083263,I’ve lost all faith in Republicans. I’m embarrassed by Trump and everything that he gets away with and the Republicans are too chicken to do anything about it.

US:155886107,"Because Democrats are evil and most of the time downright stupid with no common sense. Just look what Biden administration did… gender idiocy , transgender/ LGBTQ… for example. And then people wonder about all the natural disasters. They have nothing to do with so called climate change! It’s what God says would happen to a nation that turns their back on him! Also those who kill (such as Arbortion) are to be killed also."
US:1531802,I liked Richard Nixon
US:42604904,I care about people

US:4399493,They didn’t listen to the people. I would have voted for Biden but the very thing happened that they feared trump as president.
US:121399723,"It was because of all the lying and the direction the country was taking, which was far from our Western values."

US:42684931,I FELT THEIR WAYS WERE BETTER AND MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE TIMES
US:39471690,The GOP has been captured by Donald Trump.
US:2757816,Their policies tend to make more sense.
US:1125472,Started paying attention to presidential elections and legislation

US:357377,As a former Greenpeace and Ralph Nader supporter I saw Al Gore blowing up the dangers of climate change and the rest of the Democrats using it politically to scam voters for money. I disliked every Republican nominee until Donald Trump and voted for him all three times he won.
US:3997343,"I admired John Kennedy as I was growing up. I believe in fairness to minorities and all people. Jimmy Carter is the President I most admire. Although often the Democratic Party goes a bit overboard, they are closer to my beliefs about freedom and respect for ALL peoples."
US:4203069,individual rights and freedom of expression

US:139628455,To try to defeat the orange idiot (i refuse to use his name).
US:46344448,"I was stunned that the Republican party would put a gross, sleazy, misogynist, incompetent, ignorant, uneducated, draft-dodging crook on the ticket. I was more stunned that the stupid democrats didn't stop it from happening! They utterly failed in their message, focusing instead on dumb, fringe, ideological talking points. THEN in the aftermath of January 6, the Republicans became moral invertebrates (or showed their true essence), and the Democrats flailed and failed, misunderstanding working class Americans entirely. And then, in 2024, they once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Bad Palestine policies, bad immigration policies, bad platform, very bad candidate (for whom I voted, trying to save the country from the very mess it's in now). Disgusted with both parties. Finally, in 2025 the whole insanity of the Trump so-called-presidency has become clear and I am absolutely furious at both parties in Congress and think frankly that they should all be thrown out of Congress and lose their citizenship for being such traitors: Trump is a clear and present danger to the nation. For gods sake what is the matter with them! This is Fall Of Rome level weakness! They need to get him OUT of office, act fast to shore up election safety and voting rights, and make sure this NEVER happens again!"
US:3611596,"I believe in the social issues, education and human rights"

US:2968047,I wanted to.
US:124059747,I follow the truth and what is right and I found the Republican party does the opposite
US:1122219,"In recent years, both the Republican and Democratic parties have grown increasingly divisive and extreme, prioritizing partisan loyalty over collaboration and common ground. Rather than working together to solve pressing national issues, each side often resorts to vilifying the other, creating a toxic political climate that fuels polarization and alienates moderate voices. This growing extremism has eroded public trust in government and made compromise seem like a weakness instead of a strength. As a result, meaningful policy progress is frequently stalled, and the needs of everyday Americans are lost in the noise of ideological battles."
US:39737022,"Trump. He is the worse of the worst, both politically and personally"
US:33688478,Democrats have a big tent and take care of people. Republicans tend to have a narrow group of affinities and espouse misanthropic ideologies in general.
US:43908780,Mostly stand to with their principles value
US:672969,"Pick any major topic - border security, the economy, inflation, crime, oil, health care, our public schools, homelessness, all this DEI crap, the anti-Semitism riots in our colleges, our crushing national debt, and many more. all of these issues are totally out of control and I don’t think anybody can argue that.

US:3154658,I hated the Democrats reaction to September 11th.
US:171936,"I have been a supporter of working class representation such as that displayed by Joe Biden, fixing the problem not the blame.

US:26018544,I'm progressive and liberal
US:2324197,Believe government is there to protect our constitutional rights and provide for the needs of the people and the country. Definitely not solely for the benefit of billionaires or an ego maniac president.

US:35143685,"For the first time in my life, I'm watching people try something new, a different way of doing things, which, to me, indicates that they realize the old way was not working. A small measure of progress, but progress all the same."

US:2034235,The GOP only seems to be working to further help the rich and not do anything to help others. There are many millionaires in the country. One thing I think should be done is remove the max amount that goes to Social Security. This would greatly help.
US:40871783,They lean towards the way of the word of God.
US:138662129,"The Democrats' views, at least their spoken views, are much closer to mine, than the Republicans. But that's why I identify as a Working Families Party member. The Democrats talk the talk but they don't walk the walk nearly as often as they should."
US:132689347,I believe in personal responsibility and small gov't.
US:185808189,"I prefer to elect people who speak about the issues and not call for the killing of the opposite party. I am all for free speech, but direct threats have no place in politics. the Democrat leadership is the worst at calling for the death of people elected by the people."
US:4210623,"Because I don’t agree with capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism."
US:180805935,My perspective is this: Republicans privilege the rich and punish the poor
US:113284831,"Im not sure I really am a republican. I would love to see much less government control. However since most people are not willing to see anything other than democrat and republican, I definitely believe more or the republican side of things. Democrats are looney tunes."
US:151897851,"I favor limited government, free trade, American leadership in the world through alliances and candidates with strong personal character. Republicans once believed in these anyway."
US:180464653,Because we don’t need a dictator
US:88813,"I am not a Republican. Meanwhile, I left the Dems because I am anti-woke. I left the party mostly over its foolish support of erroneous gender ideology and unscientific trans nonsense, which harms gays, lesbians, women and children."

US:38520694,Because they do more working people.
US:2293830,Because my dad taught me at an early age about the difference between right and wrong.
US:28077894,"I originally registered as a Democrat. I realized my beliefs lined up much more with republicans on almost every issue. Democrats have went way too far to the left. I do believe most in both parties owe too many favors to be of much use by the time they are elected. Donald Trump is a rarity and doesn’t owe any since he didn’t need the money of others. By his actions, he has sacrificed to perform this service."
US:193927367,"conservatism, social conservatism, and economic libertarianism"
US:38105873,Because the democreatic party represents the interests of the working class people while the Republicans represent the wealthy and are moving our government toward autocracy.
US:138685563,Because I think God cares about the least of us. I don't think God cards just about abortion or supporting our troops. I think the American right too often conflates patriotism with religiosity.
US:126518181,I like most Republicans better
US:46414589,"I believe the previous answer covers both questions, so please see above.I mean the Democrats stand for nothing but self serving policies that benefit their total corruption, not to mention the war mongering, pro censorship, pro corruption (they fought and continue to fight anti corruption policy, ANTI stricter laws against pedophiles and criminal illegal immigrants (that there should tell you all you need to know about these reprehensible people)."

US:201363447,"because I believe in promoting equality, social justice, and the idea that everyone deserves access to basic rights and opportunities."
US:34145552,Because Joe Biden promised the union workers on the pipeline that they would keep their jobs if he was elected. On his first bay in office he stopped all work on thepipeline by executive order
US:515170,"Voted Democrat since 1992...and saw the lies and lack of action in ideas they ran on, so I decided to try the other side."
US:772004,I always look at the person and what they stand for. What their record shows me. The record of the the parties chase my thinking and thus my vote often.
US:142515919,"I've never had enough money, or hate to be a Republican"
US:203883375,They both work for the same lobbying groups.
US:2415473,My parents were
US:22516995,After many years of crazy Democrats crap
US:287838,Why I don't agree with them on all issues the republican party aligns with most of my beliefs and values.
US:144247759,"I am a Democrat because I believe in taking care of people and doing what is good for people.

I am disappointed in the Democratic party, but I believe in the Democratic party over the Republican party."
US:134380679,They usually promote positions I agree with
US:2333011,"Moral values are aligned with most republicans. The idea of fiscal responsibility, although most members of congress seem to lose this value once elected. A belief in a strong state government not an overreaching federal government."

US:193247259,My view points are more left of center
US:135772005,I’m for protection of democratic norms and supportive of free trade and economic growth. I’m also concerned about individual freedom being preserved.

US:30005739,"I support social services, human rights, protecting the environment."
US:169695815,"I'm farther left than the Democratic party, but still left."
US:2915372,I no longer believed what the Dems were saying and doing to move this country towards social communist country
US:25445867,I decided to be Republican because They seems be more trueful and Honest and Don't lie like Democrats do
US:40966041,"I saw the destructive results of the Democrats policies in my home state of IL, and decided I want nothing to do with them."
US:169221259,"I care more about people, animals, and the environment than I do about money"
US:124256801,I believed in pieces from both sides and somethings which neither the parties had. I was given my own name at birth I don't need a new one.
US:4275427,Because I care about other human beings

US:1471094,I like their stand on the most issues
US:136676055,See above.
US:198305879,I saw that the policies of the Republicans often took the position to enrich the wealthy and to undermine services to the impoverished. I believe that the best course of action is to lift one's situation by lifting the entire community together.

US:691163,better serve the people
US:198027213,S/A
US:38505578,Democrats suck
US:2508851,They had smarter people.
US:105353785,I saw all the good things that President Obama did in his first term and I also saw how nasty Republicans treated him. The lies they told were so egregious that it really opened my eyes and I began to be more careful about voting and started educating myself by doing more research about issues.
US:835736,Because of the policies of the Republicans.
US:170055111,Agree with the path and that way of life

US:137783557,Neither one cares about the people who live and work in this country. They both make living here hard.
