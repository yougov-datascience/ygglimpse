US:117816353,Do not agree with Democrats..
US:150923839,"I identify more with progressives than I do with the Democratic party, proper. But I consider myself a Democrat because I believe in the principle that government should steward and benefit citizens through public works, research and funding, and social support programs. I also believe that the neoliberalization of government since the 1980s has catastrophically widened the wealth gap and failed to deliver benefits to all but the most wealthy Americans. Over the past decade, I have seen a terrifying rise of racist, bigoted, and patently misinformed views associated with the GOP and Donald Trump as its figurehead. I am exhausted by the discrimination this party aims at American citizens, those who wish to become citizens, and those who enter our country in need of asylum. I am exhausted by the vitriol towards BIPOC folks and the LGBTQ community. I am terrified that childbearing people will not get the healthcare they need because of abortion bans. I am terrified that Donald Trump is single-handedly destroying our economy and our respected position in world politics. And I am ashamed that our country has elected Donald Trump as president for a second term."

I think people should do what they want and be left alone but they also should not be able to have 1 percent of the people mess up 99 percent of the people.

US:139527795,Social programs
US:167873871,I vote issues not platforms
US:192371409,Trump does what most presidents has done and they make a big deal out of it like not giving due process to illegal immigrants. Another reason is that democrats care about identity politics which nobody cares about.

US:176733001,"Ever since Donald Trump ran for president in 2015, Republicans are unable or incapable of standing up for their constituents, even when Mr Trump's policies are not in their constituents' best interest. Plus, I don't trust any Republican, especially Donald Trump, after how the attack on the capitol played out. Republicans are either lying or delusional when they claim that the events of January 6, 2021, were peaceful and not an attempted coup. Now that Donald Trump has been re-elected, his delusional take on reality cannot be trusted. Moreover, Democratic positions and policies help everyone, while Republican positions and policies primarily, if not solely, benefit Anglo Saxon, protestant men. Democrats seem to be focused on the future, while Republicans are stuck in the past, but a fantastic past that never actually existed."

They don't care about who they promote - think Herschel Walker, MTG, George Santos, Boebert, Hegseth, Musk... They do nothing about the corrupt Supreme Court judges that they stacked to do their bidding. They have combined white supremacy, corporate greed, Christian Nationalism, and Curtis Yarvin’s ""philosophy."" They think ditching the Constitution and suppressing Congress and the Judiciary and letting the president have immunity for crimes committed in office are improvements. They did nothing about taking Musk out of his rapid course of destruction. They just voted to deport American citizens. I am not pleased with Democrats because they tend to use tax money to create programs for a limited population over and over while I worked hard for that money but at least they do it out of concern for some people."

US:178340357,I think the major problem with the functioning of our government is due to these two major political parties who refuse to work together and also refuse to work for the people.

US:192777411,After 2001 I thought republicans were the way to go but by 2007 or 2008 I started to see how republicans acted. Also I was getting fully into adulthood. Then republicans just started getting worse ans worse and democrats just made a lot more common sense to me.

US:193198921,"I am not a fan favorite of any politician, because regardless of the party 🎉 he or she are known crooks, criminals, and liers that I don’t trust. Mr. jimmy Carter is, and was the only President that truly made a difference. The President that is in office, and 99% of those before him should be in prison, especially Mr. Trump, JD Vance, and Mr. E. Musk."

US:200818699,This what I have always idenified

US:149749489,I am not into politics.
US:205174765,It appears Republicans make better choices for America
US:290464,"I am conservative, I don't agree with most liberal ideas. I think Republicans are more about the common man"
US:2409084,because republicans suck
US:3074529,"It represented my views about being the party of working people, the poor, and the downtrodden"
US:24283092,Because I care about others and prefer a democracy where we all take care of each other instead of only looking out for myself
US:3416672,"They stand for less government, are against abortion, are against foreign involvement especially wars, are for greater freedom and are strict Constitutionalists."
US:2865802,dem are wrong all of the time. too liberal.

US:176660221,As I got older became more conservative
US:39857116,It seemed that I agreed with the republican platform much more than the democratic one.
US:1915603,Democrat party (and influential members) lost reality and began censoring freedom of speech.
US:154799359,Due to the many actions by Republicans and Trump I truly believe the republican party must be fully dissolved because most of them could care less about Americans and what the U.S. stands for.
US:117063461,I think of myself as a Republican because I feel the party is on the right side of most issues.
US:46854801,I think government should be limited. Citizens should depend on their selves
US:141316529,"My values align with Democrats. Never have aligned wit republicans - who are now supporting a criminal running an authoritarian government and a cabal that wants to destroy our government, cultural and educational institutions"

US:29864847,"Tends to be more of a party for average person, middle of the road American"
US:188327943,Because both parties are more concerned with cultural issues like Stop the Steal and DEI than they are with fixing important economic issues like the cost of living and stagnant wages
US:193760887,Because I believe in drawing lines and setting boundaries on certain issues facing the country. I found that those issues were taken too lightly.
US:2474594,Democratic party is too focused on making sure they are the only ones in power at all levels. Republicans are too principaled to govern effectively.
US:495847,Because the ideology and the policies of the liberals do not align with what I believe.
US:29454577,"My answer to the previous question explains it, so I will repost it here: I had been a Republican back in the 1970s and 1980s, but switched to Democrat when the Republican Party became infested with Rush Limbaugh. I switched back to Republican because of the Democrats supporting DEI and funding universities. The problem with universities extends beyond crazy left wing stuff. Science actually has become infected because too much money has been spent in it, and it has become a big bureaucracy, often advancing nonsense because people want to conform. I still do prefer the Democrats on smoking--they are more supportive of smoking bans in public places and other anti-tobacco measures. I slightly prefer the Democrats on other environmental issues, but they are now pretty weak. For example both Biden and Harris supported fracking, and the Democrats chose a coal lobbyist, Jaime Harrison, to be the head of the DNC just prior to the current head. Why did they do this? Because he was black, and that is all they care about."
US:39565636,I believe in the United States of America. I believe in our constitution. I believe in law and order. I don’t believe in the far left ideology that has spread through our educational and social systems. I believe in President Trump’s administration to make America great again! God bless all!

US:131893163,I oppose killing babies
US:145200391,"The way Republicans ""behaved"" during Obama's term in office was a turn off. Democrats seemed to want to do things for us while Republicans seemed, and still seem, to want to do things for them not their constituents"

US:186895145,Believe in the constitution not interpretations that fit other ideas
US:31505686,Democrats do much more for the people. Republicans work for the wealthy and don't seem to care at all for anyone without money. The rich get richer at the expense of those without money. Their taxes should be greatly increased. It wouldn't affect their standard of living one iota.
US:3089805,"I consider myself center, or slightly left of center on the majority of the issues. The majority of Republicans don't support my options on the majority of issues. This is especially true today with the MAGA extreme right, especially on social issues."

US:1215825,I’m working class and former Union member
US:40642036,The Republicans seem to be more aligned with what their constituents want!

US:4515565,Because there are only two viable political parties and the GOP have proven to be aganst everything the US Constitution says and stands for.
US:3141918,They most closely align with my beliefs
US:32546137,"I hold to a view that our nation needs to get back to Biblical values. A nation that murders a million babies a year for the sake of anything goes, and no morality will be judged by God.

US:130887335,"I am a bit conservative, but do not think of myself as a strong Republican. I try to focus on issues, not parties"
US:2631103,"Because I don't think we should be giving taxpayer dollars to the whole world. I don't know who decided we are the protectors of the world. Money going everywhere else could be spend her to fix our roads, highways and everything else that's falling apart. I pay more for my health care now that I'm retired than when I worked with less funds. Why can't I get mine for free too."
US:28202945,I think both sides have good and bad points and I have voted for both parties

US:1316518,"The Democratic Party has historically been the party which proposed and implemented major positive changes.

US:3666980,"I dont believe in the way Democrats want to make the country into a Socialistic state. Example, California ran by Gavin Newsom Mandates laws and the courts agree with him, but if a Republican did the same thing, the Left Wing Activist Courts would strike down the mandates as they are Unconstitutional."

US:38150523,It's the only ethical party choice. Republicans have completely lost their way.
US:2606768,"I have watched all of the corrupt things that the republicans have none to help the rich, and not the poor."
US:112322401,For the work people the poor and needed people
US:197042513,Morals
US:40429605,my parents are democrats and we always boo'd the republican floats when they went by in the parades.
US:191074421,"There is a genuine desire to help people and make a better nation, even if they aren't in agreement as to what that looks like and how to do it. A commitment to avoid doing evil goes a long way in my book."
US:206879589,Because their principles align so much with mine
US:40749114,"Because I believe in God and my country was founded by the principal s and laws and the good book, the Bible!! We fought for our freedom and lost many lives to make the US free. I'm a believer!!"
US:2970581,The answer to this is included in the above answer
US:200185177,Active
US:482788,I want to deport illegals not support them. I support the police and don’t want them defunded. I want criminals in jail not roaming the streets. I want violent protesters in jail. Democrats support the exact opposite things than I do. They are wasting money flying to El Salvador visiting an illegal gang member. Democrats definitely don’t care about America or Americans.
US:134900403,I align more with their beliefs
US:3448310,They look at for people
US:29677730,The positions of the Democratic Party are in agreement with mine far more often than Republican Party positions.

US:144423357,They are the better option
US:41902346,Democrats are out of touch
US:193479349,Because it fits my ideas and values.
US:1202726,because democrats went too far left in their goals
US:4542405,I agree with more of the Republican planform than the Democrats
US:155971683,Cuz I'm more conservative and definitely not liberal!
US:194036659,"The democrats favor socialsism,communism, marxism and try to destroy our country with their policies"
US:148223427,I am a Democrat because we believe in actual freedom and individual rights. The Republican party has forgotten what individual freedom is and done everything they can to restrict freedom of choice and ignore established law.
US:166176695,Because of the policies of that party
US:163192995,"America was good. Growing up, I loved this country so much and had immense pride. After what the democrats have done- our country is crime ridden, and debilitated to a point that I fear it's irreversible, and we are going to crumble like many other empires have."
US:2760647,Because they’re a better choice than the alternative
US:194929215,"If it doesn't make sense, there's a reason. Any President that doesn't have an America first agenda shouldn't be President"
US:39890684,Can't say
US:188063509,Government exists to protect its people and give them opportunities to thrive in the US.
US:194191991,Not sure
US:23655346,"Because that is the party I am registered as. I register in a party so I can vote in primaries and also when I used to live in New York there were often no Republican primaries so I felt I could participate more in the political process by being a Democrat, and I didn't change my party after moving because I didn't feel any more aligned with the Republicans than I do with Democrats."
US:35751182,I didn't agree with the democrats views on most issues and I do not like where the party is at anymore. I agree mostly with the views and beliefs of the Republican party. The better align with my feelings and beliefs.
US:29769192,I just want to be left alone and the government to have little to zero influence in my life. That’s what freedom is.
US:3520768,Both parties need to have TERM LIMITs. These life long politicians are all crooks. They have dirt on both sides.
US:31154189,Believe in republicans actions and government beliefs
US:2907015,The importance of freedom of speech and having strong national security
US:25185204,"I value freedom, fairness, equal rights, and supporting the middle class people."
US:41013035,The Democrats have proven throughout history to be the side promoting and protecting the worst aspects of human nature.
US:27586924,I support moral values and god and country
US:121261917,"Republicans are mostly an anti-party, against too many things I believe in and too often just vote to oppose Democrats not to accomplish anything positive or helpful."
US:198997249,I am in moderate in my politics and feel the Democratic Party represents those interests and policies.
US:27796750,It's the party of sanity.
US:23312295,The Democrats are completely insane.
US:4661069,Always had a more liberal slant toward social issues
US:125711769,Because they value the same things I do
US:133089909,"I believe in caring for people, free speech, minority rights"
US:121586369,"I believe that the government should stay out of our personal business. Democrats just want to take more of our money to spend on their pet projects that are just wasteful. Government should follow the constitution, protect US Citizens and our border. Put America First!!!"
US:4180727,When republicans put Donald trump up I knew my values didn’t align
US:2601198,I agree with general Democratic focus of helping people Succeed and live Healthy lives.
US:183230147,The Democrats are utterly incompetent and evil. They live in a fantasy world and want ultimate control. Republicans for all their flaw like freedom.
US:133669761,"Sometimes the views of Democrats are ridiculous as also in Republicans, so I’m split in the middle"
US:1823459,Democrats want to force people to agree with their policies and seek to punish anyone who disagrees. Republicans generally want fewer laws and federal government controls over private lives and property.
US:33204863,"They align more with the direction I believe this country should go. Democrats have gone so far to the radical left that I cannot support them. They have no clear plans, only criticism and obsession with ridiculous agendas. They want and defend illegal criminal aliens."
US:173586335,"B/c I like all people , I want democracy, I understand history, I’m a critical thinker"
US:171423689,Because I care about every day people and not just the wealthy. I care about healthcare access for all and the needs of the working class.
US:2727969,The other party sucks
US:189853217,I am a democrat because I think the democratic party stands more for the people of the country and care more about the welfare of its citizens.
US:178896471,The democrats are corrupt and grand stand to protect their power and create headlines rather than consider common sense and getting things done for the people. They want to control everyone and people are simply a means to maintain power.
US:2950471,"I want smaller government, lower taxes, and liberty. I want equal opportunity not out comes. I don't trust the government or the media"
US:156255717,"Clinton was horrible. The Democrats no longer even pretended to be liberal. The DNC ignored the will of their party members to nominate the candidate of their choice. And Sanders went along with it. He got paid for it. They became friendly with awful neocons. They became as censorious as Republicans and their speech police moved the social center far to the left. They became pro-Wall-Street and pro-war. I've never thought of myself as a Republican. Their ""family friendly"" policies and decisions based upon religion are an anathema to me. They've always been a censorious, pearl-clutching, and war-driven party. At least they listened to their party members when Trump ran on their party's ticket in the last three elections. They didn't pull dirty tricks to prevent it."
US:1318022,I agree with the values that they represent
US:178225,Republicans better represent my conservative belief's
US:192327411,I don’t have a strong preference
US:27067606,Th GOP gets the job done always.
US:4621054,I believe in community and policy that lifts EVERYONE. I DON'T believe the interests of wealthy and business should be top priority. I believe we should care fir our environment and move away from fossil fuels. I want universal Healthcare and strong public schools. I believe women should have reproductive freedom.
US:192966227,"Democrats want power, Republicans want money. Neither gives a shit about the people."
US:206718369,They both are run by dinosaurs. Get old people out of government. Let the people who will deal with the policy in life decide stuff. Not some 100 year old pile of shit making laws they'll never see
US:178816649,I do not agree with anything that today’s republicans say
US:1968631,Democrats have evolved into Socialists. They give away too much taxpayer money with no accountability. Democrats have forgotten their ROOTS. The United States is a Republic. Each State is supposed to be a Democracy. The Democrats have failed the people in general.
US:4021985,Since 1964
US:2383381,"My cultural values align better; the republican party has no interest in governing, only in keeping power."
US:2426526,"They align with my pro life views, 2nd amendment strong foreign affairs pro military"
US:2392425,Conservative
US:147018857,"I was raised by democrats, and I feel constrained by the 2-party system and thus continue to call myself a democrat even though the party has moved far to the right of my politics."
US:128311491,"I’m only closer to the Dems because I abhor the near-Fascist Republican Party. They wish to destroy the rule of law and destabilize our democracy. So, in this case the Dems are the lesser of two evils."
US:878659,My values and respect of law are in agreement with the Democratic party
US:43200314,"Because it's the party of workers, small government, lower taxes, and personal freedoms."
US:1110411,"Conservative values, they care more about America."
US:39564053,I think we were taught a vision of America that never really existed and learned to strive for a lie. I realized that government rarely works for the poor or marginalized. That we have to fight for them and us.
US:180355483,Have more conservative view and pro Christian values
US:43596614,i do not align myself with either party as some of my views are conservative/republican and some are liberal/democrat. I think the 2 party system is doing this country a grave disservice.
US:184937445,has a thinking in my mind that I agree with
US:180949813,The Republican Party has generally been more in touch with the needs of the American People. Which is exactly how I think our politicians should be rather than supporting non citizens.
US:37849778,Because they are closest to my values
US:142630619,They follow through on what they say
US:123270405,"Same as above, entire family both sides were all Dems."
US:130255147,Democrats follow the rule of law and the Constitution
US:25273077,I realized that generally that party supported or at least did not oppose the policies that I preferred. Democrats also seem to be the only political party in the US interested in governing.
US:180118921,"Because I am a Bible believing Christian. Democrats lie, abortion is murder, homosexuality is an abomination, child indoctrination in carnal knowledge is an abomination, transgenderism is an abomination, democrats are being proven to be thieves, democrats are one sided with criminal justice, democrats use legalized warfare against their opponents, democrats support illegals over American citizens, democrats do very little to help the poor - seniors - veterans and list goes on and on."
US:170765277,"The dems are out of their minds with DEI, affirmative action, immigration, womans sports. They have no ideas of their own."
US:101022261,Freedom of speech and fiscal responsibility
US:114311841,I believe that there is too much money wasted by Washington. I am against abortion and DEI. The Democrats have become increasingly socialistic and immoral since the late '60s.
US:3678151,I feel that the Democratic party has a better connection with the rights and needs of the people.
US:28153591,because the alternative would be reprehenisible
US:148926167,"We live in a completely stifled two-party system, and unfortunately the only party that's slightly better at supporting the needs of the working class is the Democratic party."
US:170546285,The whole truth is I don't believe anyone nor any person who can change an order who charge things that is not in their nature or in their heart.
US:1559441,they make sense
US:1907018,"The Libertarian Party was unable to field candidates in all of the elections that I can vote for. So I have had to choose between two parties, neither of which match my own philosophy very closely."
US:180659271,"Because rationality only applies to that party. The MAGA party is, by definition, irrational."
US:41052864,I am not a religious right-wing nut job.
US:109852547,Not sure
US:1160325,Somewhat of a birthright. First my father showed his views on politics and I followed suit.
US:178061109,"I believe in many more of that party's ideals. Also, I am 100% against Trump."
US:151299421,I have always lived in a Republican state.
US:190468115,Because it is a strong party
US:178529855,Because it depends on the issue at hand and how each party intends to address it.
US:167953149,Better opeople and ideas
US:183104753,"I believe the Dems are more inclusive to minorities and work to build a multi-cultural society where people have the tools and support to build their American Dream. I think the Dems are more likely to make decisions about climate change, public health, economics, etc. based on science."
US:134488149,"In the past, I sometimes understood the Republican positions but today I can't align with any Republican positions so I must align with the Democratic Party. I don't think the Republican Party exists like it once did after Donald Trump came onto the scene. In general, the Democratic principles aligned with my beliefs, but I don't think they take enough action. I'm more aligned with people like Bernie Sanders and AOC and the social democracy movement."
US:140033901,Democrats look after the people. Republicans look for power and control and do virtually nothing for the good of the people.
US:40432940,The democrats have done nothing but make things worse in this country!
US:120519847,Values
US:2786276,"Reason, logic, and common sense mean something to me and throwing money at a problem has NEVER worked."
US:41828812,"Lower taxes, regulation"
US:474324,The Democrats only care about spending money and lining the pockets of their supporters. They are mostly corrupt.
US:25960898,I am more conservative in my ideas than liberal.
US:181703323,"The basic values, being more pro business, for less goverment."
US:32595232,"There is no longer a republican party, it is now MAGA, which is clearly fascist."
US:37964033,Common sense and they are aligning with MAGA values
US:2777334,Fiscal conservative
US:40853257,I relate with the political viewpoint of most republicans. I do not agree with the progressive Democrats. Any one with common sense and integrity would side with the ones who listen to the majority of the people. Things will never be perfect but politicians should not have free rein on our hard earned money. All have abused their power but at least the republicans are trying to correct the wrong.
US:1925084,I believe I. The constitution
US:34371433,I believe elected representatives should represent and vote in lock step with what their constituents want and Dems do that better
US:186387017,They are more first rule of law and lives of average Americans
US:186512013,Don’t know
US:2134129,Because it is the party of common sense.
US:42603758,Religious right is not politics. Separation of church and state shouldn't be compromised.
US:2840119,I do not like the Lying that goes on in the Socialist Democrat Party.
US:183590675,"I believe in separation of church and state. I used to be a republican because I am an economist by education and profession and believe in free markets and world trade. Over time, the Republican Party has shifted from protecting free markets and defeating communism to focusing on promoting a Christian theocracy that doesn't match my beliefs. My own viewpoints are something closer to Rockefeller Republicanism than today's Democratic Party but the Democrats are the least bad choice available."
US:185540091,I don't think government should be in the business of social engineering. I think government should be smaller and less involved in business and individuals lives.
US:180748513,Obama exuded hope & compassion toward all people in the nation. He was friendly and respectful toward everyone.
US:104625503,I believe in traditional family and God fearing values and cherish this country.
US:29687843,"Democrats encourage more government spending causing waste, fraud and abuse"
US:2813844,never
US:291858,"The Democrats have done better running the economy. A Democrat balanced the budget, reduced inflation, and encouraged job creation."
US:388889,I believe the peoples voice should be heard and follow up with some type solutions to it to it. To benefit the people and the government
US:37516762,"When I found out how much the Democrats had changed and how much fake news is being spread by the liberal media. I used to think they were reporting the facts, then I realized that is not so."
US:201697189,I like immigrants and gays
US:2674554,Most Republicans at least pay lip service to conservative values. Almost all Democrats do not.
US:4556319,Was forced to declare myself as a Republican when I was 18
US:25959865,I agree more with their views.
US:146374001,At this point it is about who is going to do the least amount of harm.
US:999307,The Republican Party is farther-away from my political views than the Democratic Party.
US:207504775,Democrat leaders/representatives genuinely care about the people and listen to the people’s needs
US:180837205,Because Republicans think the same way I do and have the same ideals.
US:46123684,I agree with the party's ajanda
US:31983144,"I am from the working people, and we work hard to take of our family"
US:1830047,I'm a conservative person who is family oriented. God is first in my life and I will always pray for our country of freedom for all.
US:22539050,Not sure
US:27157409,"I believe in personal responsibility, law and order, cutting taxes, supporting police and military, pride in being American, equal opportunity for all (not equity)"
US:151759861,Because I don't trust any politician
US:41797019,Share values and almost always vote for Democratic candidate

US:170297255,I am liberal on the majority of social issues
US:149312475,the Democrats are nuts and wildly out of touch
US:173315639,I THINK GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL. I THINK ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WAS OUT OF CONTROL. I THINK CHINA AND THE TRADE POLICIES ARE OUT OF CONTROL
US:4013477,"When Trump was elected the first time, things changed for the better for the middle class and small businesses and he was tougher on immigration and the country was thriving once again. Republicans in office work best for me."
US:1022013,Republicans are more in line politically with my views.
US:188429969,i am liberal
US:22758472,Like the president's who are
US:2354869,"I just don't want to be known as a democrat. Really, I identify more with Maga, and with the constituion, and the bill of rights."
US:196820905,"I believe everyone deserves a chance to share in the nation’s wealth. I believe we should assist those who need help. We should treat everyone equally. Everyone should pay their share in taxes which benefit everyone. I believe the U.S. should spend less money on the military and more on social welfare. I believe our civil rights, democracy and the constitution should be protected."
US:140251567,I most closely align with Republican values.
US:134351819,"Both parties are all about big government, they just differ on what big government should do. I want people to be able to run their own lives"
US:3343879,Democrats have an evil agenda
US:184534221,People don’t always deserve everything and those who have earned something shouldn’t be forced to fund anything.
US:185130269,Because too far left or right is a bad place to be especially the left
US:195714785,"Me identifico más así, la democracia es derecho del pueblo, todos tienen el derecho a reclamarlo"
US:181662917,Think they both don't work for the country
US:184468361,I am conservative in my views.
US:185031127,Mostly because my parents taught a Democrats were good people and did the right thing
US:184201605,"I can see points from both sides. There are policies I can back from both parties; i.e.: the immigration reform from the Republican party, and the environmental policies from the Democratic party."

US:133936283,"Conservative values, work hard, don't support people on the doles forever or workmthe syste. Capitalism, opportunity, rules, accountability"
US:31319470,Think the Dems are more for the common person

US:161463865,"Both the Democratic party and Republican party are incredibly corrupt. They're both run by the wealthy elite. They don't care about anybody else.

US:34410982,Closer to my political beliefs
US:103485521,I did not like what the Democratic party was wanting where illegals were concerned.
US:137748065,Because I was raised that way

US:34349829,"Conservative values; law and order champion; prioritize weeding out of governmental waste, corruption; drain the swamp; get federal spending under control; start paying down the national debt; get schools and education back on the right track; and emphasize making America great again."
US:2463677,am not closer to any party
US:171427105,They are horrible and toxic
US:180034539,When I realized that I agree with concepts of both parties
US:3576302,Health care is important but saving a shred of our national identity and democracy is now on the line
US:199812289,I pick the person running and not the party
US:2258609,Each of them has at least one deal-breaker position that prevents me from formally aligning myself with either.
US:145429361,Because I believe government should work for all people not just the rich.
US:1555985,"Because I believe in ""a government of the people, by the people & for the people""""!!"
US:161819797,beczuze im a chrisrian
US:2895306,because their polcy are closer to my thinking
US:394909,"In the past 35 years, I've seen the republican party for what they are: politicians who are only out for their own benefit. The republican party has become the republicant party. Thy are rooted in The Swamp just as deeply as the democrats. Still, if there is no other suitable candidate, I will vote republican."
US:32322739,The Republican Party does nothing.
US:39355415,My beliefs ad values more closely align with those of the democratic party.
US:34613598,Want the government to do their jobs and be for the people not against
US:166901911,Could never be a republican
US:4081090,Dems have lost their way. Gone left.
US:44211633,"Since 2001 both Party's have drifted farther and farther away from listening to or attempting to do ""the will of the People"". Reagan was the last Republican president to put the People before Party and Clinton the last to do so. Both were good Presidents and I voted for both of them. The Congress of both parties have been abysmally bad since well before either of those Presidents. Since 2000 the Democrat Party has promised greater equity and freedom for the People but seems to have launched into a crusade towards some kind of hybrid authoritarian socialism, communism or just plain lunacy where Government decides what is best for the nation and We the People as a result are less equal and much less free. The Republican Party likes to campaign on lesser, fairer taxation, smaller, less intrusive government, and more individual freedoms. Problem is they don't deliver on any of that. Even when they hold majorities in both the Executive and Legislative branches. Both sides are too full of themselves and their own narrow vision of what is good for the Country. And the Country? It's been run (into the ground) by a bloated, greedy, uncaring, Bureaucracy which has only grown larger since the 50's and whose only real interest seems to be in maintaining it's own power and control. I strongly supported the current President, Donald Trump, not because he is a Republican or a Democrat, he's been both. I support the man, not the Party. I do because he kept the promises he made his first term and he is keeping the promises he made this term. Most if not all of those promises based on what the people that voted for him (a majority of the country this term) voted for him to achieve. President Trump's methods can be absolutely cringeworthy at times but they get results. And it's about results, not the ""work"" or the ""process"" or any of the other useless BS that is used to justify or detract from the job he's doing. I've no idea whom I'll vote for in the next elections. I can tell you it won't be a Republican, Democrat or any other Party. I'll vote for the individuals that most represents the vision of Country I believe in and vote against every one of the incumbents that didn't follow through on their promises. You did ask why."
US:43920065,"Because my values are much more in line with Democrats than Republicans, and in our two party system you effectively have to choose one or the other."
US:390955,"In live in the City of Philadelphia which has been governed by a very corrupt Democratic Political Machine since 1952. I am 65 years old. All of my District City Council Persons except one (Jack Kelly) who was the only Republican elected to that seat since 1951 has gone to prison for either taking bribes, committing election fraud or both. The same thing is true for all of my US Congressman too except for one Republican, Charles F. Dougherty, who served from 1979 to 1983. Every Democratic Congressman I have ever had went to prison for taking bribes. My current Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle has yet to be indicted. But his brother, Kevin Boyle a/k/a Hunter Boyle who was a state representative, was arrested several times for drunk driving, violating a protection from abuse orders and beating up his wife. His brother, the Congressman, did his best to try to cover the whole thing up by trying to manipulate the local justice system to have the charges dropped. If this happened anywhere but Philadelphia where the Democratic Machine Puppet DA motioned to have all charges dropped after Kevin Boyle was defeated in a Democratic Primary in the spring of 2024. Anywhere else Congressman Boyle would have been indicted on obstruction of justice charges and his brother would not have had his charges quietly dropped after he left office by a Democrat Machine Judge. When no one was paying attention to the outcome of his criminal case any longer."

US:190137741,There have been changes within both parties with what each stand for over the past 10 years. Republicans are now like the Democrats of the 1960s. I also believe both parties are being controlled by the same people.
US:146042971,I believe in equal rights for all. I believe in social justice. I believe we are our brothers keeper. I have had an interracial marriage since 1970--the white men in this country were so horrible to us. I was disappointed and terrified they would hurt our children.

US:4681253,All politicians get corrupted
US:159532881,"I believe that our strength as Americans comes from our diversity. One of the earliest lessons my parents instilled in me was the importance of immigration in the history of America, even though they are not immigrants themselves.

US:2971452,I respect all people and think that our economy is serving only the rich.

US:109026109,"Both parties work for their own gain, often together, to for a ""uniparty"" against the people."

US:44458683,Same belief
US:103721945,"The Democrats believe too many decisions should be arbitrated by government and spend too much on government programs.

As a Libertarian, I believe the legitimate role of government is to protect its citizens' individual rights; not to expand government programs that interfere with the free market, mandate what products we can or cannot buy, or impose morality upon us. Neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party seems to understand this view."

US:169156455,It's something I can't keep up with nor want to debate with anyone
US:2644915,There is no longer any such thing as the democrat party. They have allowed themselves to be completely dominated by marxist / socialist / communist agents that have sworn to end our Representative Republic. They are my sworn enemies. I took an oath when I was 17 and I do not recall them saying anything about any expiration date for that oath. These people want to destroy my way of life. I cannot allow that. As far as I am concerned every fucking one of those lefty bastards can go straight to Hell and spend eternity sucking the Devil's cock.
US:3348395,"Because I am conservative, believe in God Given and family values and am not a radical."

US:4718748,"Republicans don’t deal in facts, only fear of Trump"

US:105106783,"I only think of myself closer to the Republican Party, not the RINOs, but the Maga Republican Party, because I support President Trump and the American people. I don’t support all of the Republican Party."
US:43061913,"The Republican party is against open borders, illegal aliens, crime, over the top gay and trans issues and an uncontrolled federal deficit. The party favors parental rights and education."
US:163319037,I couldn't and still can't believe that Republicans could choose someone like Trump to represent the party.
US:42731138,Because the democratic part stands for the rights of people. They care more about social issues. They stand for the middle class.

US:145637671,"I see the democratic party as the one of more compassion towards people in need. The Republican party has gone apeshit, and despite calling itself the party of smaller government they're banning things left and right that they don't agree with"
US:106131161,"abortion rights, healthcare, political freedom of speech"
US:2393122,"Same as above. When I realized the true international money powers that were behind WWI, the Bolsheviks, and most revolutions, and that those same people started WWII and told nothing but lies about the war ever since. They still control our media, entertainment, and politics to this day, including deep funds going to both Democrats and Republicans. It's all a sham and needs to be torn down and rebuilt, with the first step being ending the Federal Reserve and dual citizenship. As such, for the why, it is because I think we are at the point that we need a Third Way, not to be confused with a third party."
US:134180219,"Because demorcrats are too ""woke"""
US:31499284,i think they are better
US:37598047,Because both parties only care about oligarchs. I am not an oligarch. Neither party represents me or my values.
US:40385430,I believe in equality and dignity of all humans.
US:43892740,I would like to see the government not fight over anything.
US:142393351,republican philosophy is to lend decision and authority of control to the states individually in the united states and to not cause the federal government to need to take control of every issue.
US:967127,Republican Party only look out for the rich
US:22466450,common good for all
US:1867554,"I believe in democracy, the constitution, and the rule of law. The Republican Party has lost its way in those core American values. I believe in providing social safety nets and protections for the nation's most vulnerable, something the Republican Party has never supported. And I believe that the growing wealth disparity between ordinary people and the 1% is a significant cause of the current divide between Americans and that the Republican Party will only make that worse with the current policies and tax cut proposals."
US:40441184,I have been very disappointed with the Republican party for many years. They haven't done squat. But there is no way that I agree with Democrat ideas today.

US:29910978,closer to my family values
US:4575809,Important to keep the family in the minds of. government. Important to keep ou babies from being aborted. Important to keep out of wars. Important that the government does not send money it doe not have. Keep religious freedom.
US:154608789,"Democrats haven't gone off the deep end like the republican party has. The GOP has gone so far right since the Reagan era that it is unrecognizable today. It was bad enough, but became totally extremist under tRump"

US:181600783,"More conservative, every issue I can think of aligns better with rebublicans"
US:2263109,For all the reasons stated above. Republicans stand for the people. Want to close the borders and deport all the illegals and criminals Biden let in. Drill our own oil. Keep jobs in America and boys out of girls sports and bathrooms!
US:134706547,Because politics is very binary in the US. I am liberal so it is the logical choice
US:25458620,I consider myself a Democrat because I prioritize human rights issues over the eocnomy.
US:3955022,Because both parties blame each other and nothing gets done
US:169952135,"I don't like what the republicans stand for on their basis of abortion, gun rights, and the socio economic standings that the congress incident i've set forth within the last ten years."
US:1341357,not sure
US:3385181,I am conservative in my personal life so many of my values as a Christian resemble those of the Republicans. I believe in the Bible scriptures by which way should live our lives and the far left Democrats have gone far beyond in the wrong direction as to what I believe the Bible teaches.
US:192411359,"Becuase of the values that i hold, which seem to be more consistent with the Democract party.

US:189279421,I think democrats respect the minority
US:42794516,"The Republic party has lost any sense of morality. The Democrats have their problems but there is no way that I would vote for the Republican party now that they have embraced white supremacy, racism, segregation, internment camps, the overthrow of the government in a coup attempt, threatening LGBTQ, disappearing people, deporting legal residents without due process, locking up people with disabilities, taking away women's rights, threatening women's health, embracing a dictatorship, and villifying science and federal workers."

US:2165515,I'm Beginning to change
US:39402162,"I choose the values of the party. Strong border , one language and sovereignty"

US:29003494,more freedom
US:187086291,Not sure
US:1999302,"I believe that all people are equal and everyone have the right to better themselves through education and training. I believe in a woman’s right to control her health. I don’t believe that gov’t has the right to dictate how we are to believe both politically and spiritually,"
US:28822265,The Republican party seems to be the voice of reason between the two parties at this point. I question the Democrats standing up for someone like Kilmer Abrego Garcia. Big mistake on their part to put so much time and effort into this man when their constituents have real problems.
US:703898,More supportive of rule of law
US:682912,"I am for small, limited government"
US:183793159,The Republican party is destroying constitutional democracy in the US.

US:180744341,"The party is for the working class and lower income, that's me"
US:264246,I try to look at what wach party has done for people like me. I find that the Republican party does not serve my interests fully. I have voted for Republicans in the past and may in the future but primarily vote the Democratic ticket.
US:24328153,Because they better reflect the american values I fought for.
US:1931833,They look out for people like me. Low income and black
US:178161507,They try to lean on the Bible.
US:43164271,I care about other people
US:45115466,"I believe that we are expected to have a strong work ethic, and we can earn whatever life we want with hard work. I don't think this approach is in line with the Democrat party."
US:33635296,The person's i have voted for impressed me more than Democrats. Either way the people who do the dirty jobs and get paid so little have a hard time making ends meet.
US:41908088,I feel that the Democratic party is one for the people - unlike the Republicans that just want to make more money for the rich
US:134000315,"Will not vote republican again until they stand up for the US Constitution, Rule of Law, and against traitors. Do what is right for future generations."
US:2280343,I agree with and disgree with policies in both parties. I am anti-abortion AND anti-gun.
US:188424457,It’s how I was raised. I don’t like liberals.
US:106543723,Realized both work for their donors & not the majority of the people with a common agenda & very little difference between them.
US:193629341,I believe before we change something we should look to see what problems the change might cause and seek to minimize them.
US:190634637,"Because I believe in civil rights, women's rights, and LGBTQIA+ rights. I believe in helping those less fortunate than others. I believe that billionaires should pay their share. Corporations and the wealthy have too much power."
US:26284748,it's how i'm registered to vote
US:129537671,Because the Democrats are trying to destroy this country from within
US:142486505,Because of the party's traditional commitment to working people and its ongoing commitment to diversity.
US:837056,"Smaller government, less government intervention in everyday life. Neither side seems inclined to follow this path."
US:3214547,My values line up with being conservative
US:101112849,"MAGA has ruined everything, and the democrats are too nice. We need a third party."
US:4576585,I align with their beliefs.
US:159727159,Align with the idea of government helping people
US:27277690,what?
US:41284403,"I care about human rights, the environment, animal welfare, workers rights, education, strict gun laws, and non polluting energy sources. Republicans are attacking all of these."
US:30190846,I lean towards their vies
US:39581067,Do not remember
US:40459711,Core values that stand for a democrat
US:154924295,Because I agree with the general philosophy of the Democratic party.
US:126537219,I WAS A PART OF A UNION AND THEY SEEMED MORE FOR REPUBLICANS
US:28445093,"My views on many social issues such as abortion care, health care, minimum wage, building back the Middle Class, and non discrimination policies are more aligned with the Democrats. Plus since the era of Trump and MAGA the Republicans have abandoned all their previous positions on things like a fiscal responsibility, foreign policy (especially in regards to Russia and Ukraine), the validity of science and the rule of law in order to acquiesce to the Orange Jesus in the White House. I feel that the Republicans can no longer be taken seriously and they can no longer be trusted to make any decisions regarding our country. They espouse a pro natalist position but are proposing to slash headstart and Medicare funding and they refuse to do anything to lower the cost of child care and college, and do not support paid family leave for new parents. Their proposed $5000 baby bonus is not serious and would maybe cover 4 months of infant day care where I live (especially since the recently increase minimum wage is only $12.41/hr; almost 55% of a person's wages need to go to childcare costs). I have voted for Republicans in the past (including President, Governor, Congress and other local VA races) but unless the Republicans make some drastic changes and escape the cult they are in I would say it is not very likely that I'd ever vote Republican again."
US:145923247,Because I am very liberal person and they are the more liberal party
US:183813775,"I believe in equality, equal rights, fairness, tax the wealthy"
US:364889,"I was a card-carrying republican, but became estranged during the Religious Right takeover. Now that MAGA has taken over, I have no use for the republicans and think they have lost their way and are between a cult and the mafia."
US:4679109,Strong and confident
US:182482923,"The other side is completely lawless,lazy and entitled. Always supporting criminals, rioters.pediphiles and every other undesirable individual in this country"
US:46363594,"Becasue in almost all important respects they are the Uniparty. Both abjectly serve the parasitic financiers and the wehrmacht, both lust for total global hegemony, both seek profound censorship and Big Brother surveillance, neither gives a rat's ass about working people or children, both seek unlimited Presidential power including abuse of the pardon power and freedom from prosecution or responsibility, both are drill-drill-drill despite some performative differences by the Dems, both run horrific deficits to increase profits for financiers and the MIC, etc."
US:143342913,Realized Republicans are cold inhuman and evil.
US:133260055,I take a stricter interpretation of the Constitution and believe in more limited government.
US:25459987,I think government should be run by the people and there should be less government intrusion in the lives of the american citizens.
US:40508950,I think people/government should help people. Republicans pander to the rich while the poor get poorer. Washington needs to tax the billionaires.
US:31654889,"Of the two, it's the party that focuses it's efforts around making life better for people generally, not trying to make life worse for certain people."
US:44942032,The Democratic party policies align more closely with my views.
US:4536199,Why be a MAGA idiot
US:155549479,It's the party that most closely aligns with my values and principles. It is the best fit for me and my interest.
US:3256075,"Believe in holding people accountable and not having ""give away my money""programs."
US:138133999,The things that are important to me have been shown time and again to not be important to either party.
US:155596553,"Because I hate Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. They're both fascists, as is everyone who voted for Trump and supports him still. I don't actually think of myself as a Democrat but as more of a far-left-leaning liberal."
US:673837,"I am a registered Republican because I live in a ""Red"" state. If I want to have a say in elections I need to be able to vote on the republican ticket in the primaries."
US:46348797,The two party system is bs. They only care about their donors and lobbyist.
US:134747635,They are bought and sold just like everyone else but they don't actively try to destroy lives as often as Republicans.
US:3779180,"Republicans fix problems long term, and they stay fixed. Democrats fix things with patches that feel good when they are done, but the patches don't work for long."
US:2702713,More level headed
US:2150877,"because its the clear choice for the issues that are important to me. Environment, law, fair practices, regulations, etc"
US:126143329,not sure
US:139725973,"Because I believe it is important to take care of all people and especially those who are unable to take care of themselves either because of health, age, involuntary low income, war, crimes, etc."
US:143006723,"I'm proud of our country, of our democracy, and of our three branches of government equally maintaining order so that one person can't destroy our constitution."
US:120056,Strong conservative and that's the only place for my phylosophy
US:39929872,"When the Republicans became dogmatic, and stopped seeing nuance. Ban ALL abortions, deport everyone brown or black etc. Further when it became clear that no Repub would vote as an independent after their election."
US:129041943,I am because I align with Republicans and what we do for our country
US:140303151,Because their values align with mine.
US:182287607,"if $wording_democratic_nor_republican Party? makes any sense, so do the parties in compromising their agenda for the good"
US:120580703,My ideals always include the wellbeing of today’s society that will always be revolving.
US:43659999,I believe strongly in more of their policies instead of any other party
US:26933767,Commerce not handouts
US:2280799,"Fiscal conservative, belief that smaller federal government is what our founding fathers believed"
US:3189249,because i want the world to be trusting and free of speech and better ways to help one another
US:183059505,"I'm for the people,not corporate greed"
US:142014043,I am conservative in my views for our country and think the morals of our country are going downhill.
US:128271913,They align with the values I was raised to uphold
US:36826090,I am personally offended by both parties. I feel that they are self-serving and do not reflect the will of the people.
US:42414487,"Because Obama was, and he was who my family was supporting"
US:975384,I believe in small government and lower taxes
US:133764955,See above
US:151713159,To support a better candidate when voting
US:45708634,I believe in most of their beliefs.
US:26379928,I don't agree with either party
US:2206969,I agree with most of their positions
US:188282277,"The political platform as a whole has views that align with my values, but I still disagree with how they do things and am not a MAGA fan, so I do not vote strict Republican anymore."
US:133487487,"I believe in smaller federal government, and depending on myself to live, not the feds. I think we should have a safety net but I don’t like handouts."
US:46470128,Neither party really is working on my behalf anymore.
US:124268377,Because I agree with everything the Republicans say and stand for.
US:151472439,The extremists from both parties are dominating the political landscape
US:142972495,"I care about people and their wellbeing. I want everyone to be free to live life as they want. That means reproductive rights, LGTBQ rights, equal opportunities for marginalized groups and so many more reasons to create a better society."
US:2268180,left. went crazy
US:3082308,The Democrat Party and some Republicans run by a handful of people who look at the Constitution as a bump in the road from becoming ruled by a world/global new world order.
US:38933505,"I think the most important issues facing the country are climate change, income inequality, and access to healthcare: issues that Democrats champion."
US:166893161,Because democracy is always better for people of color
US:140482051,I’m not politically inclined
US:183807503,Because I listen to both opinions from both parties and choose what is good for the citizens hence not leaning on neither sides.
US:2527661,I no longer believe in anything the Republicans stand for.
US:206578411,"I have always been politically and socially progressive. I have always considered myself a Democrat because I had long thought that being a Democrat was synonymous with being a leftist. Slowly over the course of the last several years, as I became more educated and more politically aware and as I saw Democratic politicians move further to the right, I have become very disillusioned with the party. I disagree, to varrying extents, with much of the party's platform and am even more disappointed with the Democrats' perpetual inertia and outright refusal to deliver on even their most basic of campaign promises. Even though I hate the Democrat Party -- especially at the federal level -- I nonetheless have been a registered Democrat since I turned 18 and have always voted exclusively for Democrat candidates, and I do not expect that to change, purely because the Republicans are so much worse than the Democrats and all Independent/3rd party candidates are totally non-viable."
US:164611585,"again, neither party cares about me. I vote for whom I believe will harm me the least."
US:714897,"I was an Eisenhower and Tom McCall (Oregon's Governor) Republican. They believed in using public funds to make ordinary people's lives better. From the nations first bottle bill and cleaning up our rivers and air to promo education to land use planning government was responsible and lacked drama. It took me a while to figured out the party's switched positions. When I did figure it out, I changed party."
US:41898821,I have increasingly seen corporations and right-wing politicians doing their bidding as the greatest threat to liberty
US:4615008,they represent minorities a lot more than republicans
US:186367445,Democrats strive tio make life in the US better for all. Republicans seem to make life in the us better for the wealthy and corporate America.
US:158943699,Have same beliefs
US:182008695,"I think that government should be focused on doing what is best to protect its people, not corporations. I—naively, I realize—believe that Democrats are the party that might make that possible."
US:162661351,Helping people seems more to be a democratic position and republicans seem only to help the rich
US:1286446,"Both parties seek to have power & control over the people. Dems want to impose their liberal economic controls, while Repub wants to impose their conservative social issues. The decades of both parties pushing for more federal power as brought us to our current situation with Trump using the office to dictate what's to happen."
US:41030059,More in tune with the real world
US:28967472,Because they support my conservative values.
US:3184357,Republicans can primarily articulate what they believe and why they believe it. They follow their ideas to it’s conclusion before implementing.
US:120655447,"The republican party is the party of the new trump regime. they are weak,biased,cowering fools. I will never ever vote for a republican again ever.Where is their collectivr fight for democracy,the rules of law and our constitutional rights as Americans."
US:26680661,I used to agree with the policies of the Democrats but now days the Republicans seems to be more for the people that voted for and elected them.
US:26945606,My values more align with Democrats.
US:911080,Because the Democrat stance on most issues is the opposite of what I believe the country should stand for
US:23475501,"I want order in immigration, I want welfare reform, I am tired of giving hand outs"
US:138128115,"I feel Democrats are committed to making policies and laws that help everybody, but especially those that have the least. The are dedicated to investing in things people need everyday like healthcare, education, and roads and bridges."
US:4503682,Neither party does much of anything useful
US:4495368,I am an extremely conservative person and feel law and order should be followed and each person should pull their weight.
US:4560299,because i am a very conserative person
US:1631220,Republicans represent American values
US:2182641,"For many reasons, being more liberal in regards to social issues, supporting women's rights to abortion, caring deeply about the environment, advocating for universal healthcare & more affordable, even free higher education, hoping for mandatory parental leave & more affordable childcare, supporting diversity, equity, & inclusion, I could go on."
US:29876621,Dems seem to do less damage and follow rule of law
US:2029237,Both parties do things that are against God
US:27222726,"Ever since I was a kid. I leaded Dem on some ways, rep on other ways. And I also felt like I was choosing the least evil."
US:4553992,Their views are not as extreme
US:711506,"Believe in small gov't, States with more power than the Feds, strong military, safety net benefits but not a hand-out. Conservative monetary policy - shrink the debt!"
US:109810107,Keep my own money
US:17100,more liberal
US:138763223,They seem to see things the way I do
US:155362883,I am more conservative with many issues that fall under the Republican party
