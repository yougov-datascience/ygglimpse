US:26216761,my family are all Republicans
US:34910603,Seems to be the best choice for me
US:4510147,Because I believe all people should have the same rights regardless of who they are and how much money they make. this country has the obligation to help the people who need help. And all people pay taxes in the United States so what do they get from the government when they need help? Not a goddamn thing.
US:35972074,"Each have their problems doing the will of the people. However, the republicans are by far worse, working mainly for the wealthy. The democrats are a little better because they do work to bring programs that will benefit the public, but they are still too distant from the people who got them there."
US:131452633,"I AM A MAGA REPUBLICAN AND PROUD OF IT, BABY!"
US:172884413,it’s the right thing to do
US:189235547,"Democrats address systemic racial and economic inequality by developing long-term, inclusive solutions."
US:134456511,What makes me a Democrat because I have belief that every individual have rights under the constitution and the rule of laws.
US:955551,Not happy with what either party wants to do. Just making a mess out of this country.
US:178909913,The party aligns with majority of my beliefs and has the best interests of the people in mind for policies and rule of law.
US:31631970,Republican agenda is senseless
US:310944,I guess it has to do with the way I see the world...and wanting a smaller government.
US:1066282,I believe in less gov’t and more personal responsibility!
US:40347682,Because believe in small govt and I don't agree with the Dems on anything
US:136577369,Grew up in a democratic family
US:233468,I believe in the constitution and it should be respected.
US:141461217,"Because I believe in equality for all people, I think Democrats value, freedom of speech, the right to body autonomy, lifting up our citizens through education and providing for health care for all people"
US:2425662,"Because I believe in God, pro life and more"
US:103816505,Unsure in that
US:680943,The Republican worldview is consistent with my Christian faith
US:141883859,"We need a labor party that represents and fights in the interests of working people. Until we do, I have voted for the Democratic Party, even though they have proved themselves to be totally ineffective and lame."
US:28406238,Do not believe in Democrat objective of Socialism
US:170185181,"I value love over hate, humanity over guns, education over ignorance. I believe in women’s choice and health care. I want a brighter, kinder world for myself and my family. I believe in taking care of one another, in embracing people’s identities, and that people are stronger together."
US:931128,"Because I believe in democracy and align myself with freedom, inclusion, justice, equality, and compassion."
US:4406917,"they are more inclined to want the same things like healthcare for all, woman's rights, equality, freedom of speech"
US:205174751,"Prior to 1998, when my voting rights were taken from me, I always voted Republican."
US:26241988,The Democratic Party is insane
US:31502808,"I believe one should think through all issues and make an informed decision that is unflavored by propaganda. In my opinion, Dems are more likely to agree with this stance, while the GOP (so far) are jackbooted thugs drinking the DJTrump kool aid."
US:39495529,They are more closely aligned with my political views.
US:181607741,I see both sides
US:2644826,Because the Republican party doesn't care about society and helping those who cannot help themselves. They put profits above people.
US:45516412,I had always been a republican. But then came maga. It is to much and goes against my beliefs. I have been pushed to the democrat party. I don’t agree with everything there but I am given the right to say it at least.
US:143946137,"I think of myself as a Democrat because they're the party that more closely aligns with my values, and because I live in a state with closed primaries, so if I want to be able to select candidates at that stage of the electoral process, I need to be registered with a major party."
US:2068744,"I am in favor of supporting others, which the republicans are not. The republicans always leave office in a shambles. The democrats leave with a good economy and things getting progressively better. Democrats do lie or deceive like the republicans do."
US:2801895,I strongly believe in the Constitution Of The US.
US:878941,"Wake up ! The Democrats have lost their mind . They lie. They are a Hateful group.They support men in women’s sports, in locker rooms. Harbor illegal immigrants, and above all Do not follow the law and Rules of the Constitution. Haters all of them. They voted against the removal of tax on tips and overtime etc. a sick group."
US:173753001,Their policy choices are more in line with my views than the Republican Party.
US:202238047,"because Democrats care more about people, instead of corporations & the wealthy."
US:188838039,"Generally, Republicans are more closely aligned with what I consider Christian values."
US:46467894,They both suck
US:41525136,Not that involved in politics and I vote for who i like better
US:2688721,"The Democrats are evil and have a dangerous agenda. The Republicans are weak and don't get much done. I left all of the main political parties because none of them were closer to my political opinions. BTW, I live in a state that has been controlled by the Democrats for decades."
US:165545971,The liberal democrats only think about them self's not about the people they are to represent.
US:132829943,"The values and positions of the Democratic party align with mine on world, national, local and personal issues. I'm old enough to remember Khrushchev saying, ""We do not have to invade the US. We will destroy you from within."" On a personal level, my eldest grandchild is beautiful transgender woman. Enough said."
US:4582183,I stand with the fact that Democracy is the number on principal for me as a democrat
US:192631059,"Because as a democrat , I care more about us lower and middle class people and feel that things we rely on in our everyday lives ( Snap , Medicaid , Social Security etc. ) are being taken away by the republicans and that’s not fair to us"
US:169655929,"At this point, it's getting harder to think of myself as one-they are being exceedingly frustrating at the federal level (overall). That said, there is no other major party to push back the continuing fascism of the GOP. I guess I'm a strong progressive Democrat (more Ilhan Omar much less Amy Klobuchar)."
US:2337143,Because I believe in a strong social safety net and a government that concerns itself with the least among us first and foremost.
US:110281569,I am gen x and was raised by conservative parents. I live in rural a county.
US:24035453,Both are too focused on personal power not aiding the nation
US:3855364,I agree thatrepublications are the partythatis truly interested in keeping America strong and fateful to our original forefathers. Deocratsv are only interested in making money from their terms in office I have lived thru lots of presidents and it gets worse each time a Democrats wins the office. More money and more power is their goal
US:4660457,I lean more to their principal than I do Democrates
US:4128484,Won't say
US:189710221,They have more empathy for the people of this country
US:141972,I do not consider myself as close to any political party. None of them serve the will of the people.
US:37794622,"I agree with more of their policies, especially regarding immigration"

US:208093,democrat candidates are no good
US:1216625,"The republicans have been taken over by conservative think tanks and fundraisers such as Heritage Founation, that want to lower taxes to wealthy and shrink goverment. See project 2025 , now being enacted"
US:23666220,I just don't like most of the Republicans.
US:377770,"Neither party is independent of the actual entity in charge, they're just allowed the ""appearances"" of choice/freedom. They are both wings of the same detestable ""creature."""
US:143198901,Honestly I don’t know
US:39769403,I hate them both. They're both tools used to divide us.
US:35344139,Because I was bought up a Democrat and Democrats care more about the needs of the American people.
US:43412239,I don't like what the democrats are doing for the country
US:41069185,Sure not Democrats
US:205882997,Because I believe the current system is broken and corrupt in both parties.
US:408879,right to free speech
US:39064835,My views are much closer to Republicans
US:135932533,I believe in the direction the democratic party is moving. The republican party has started to go with a dictatorship and their representatives will do anything to be part of djt's realm.
US:109590315,Try to succeed in the govt
US:2729180,The Democrat Party does not support any of the things I think are important. The republicans are somewhat closer regarding important issues.

I don't think men should compete in women's sports events as democrats today argue. I don't think tax payer funds should be used for abortions as democrats today argue. I don't think taxpayer funds should be use to pay for sex change operations as democrats today argue. I don't think tax payer funds should be used to provide LBGTQ coloring books for Central American countries as democrats today argue. I believe judges engage in criminal acts can be arrested an charged for those criminal acts. I believe foreign nationals in this country illegally should be arrested and charged for that crime without need for a warrant: after all, no warrant is necessary to stop and arrest a bank robber for the crime of bank robbery while in the process of committing that crime. Etc., etc., etc."
US:32073809,I have the same values and beliefs as the Democratic party.
US:42597330,"Party of the people, are always trying to help the working families"
US:184043301,Because the Democratic Party is a bunch of bleeding heart liberals and stand for everything I’m against.
US:4422664,I support social programs and existing entitlement programs
US:25512329,Republicans are easier to live with than being a woke out of touch democrat
US:167050857,Only because I’m concerned about humanity and rights of people but I want to keep my hard earned money
US:2580371,"We are a democracy, not a dictatorship or monarchy. Democrats (not all) generally adhere to principles of democracy, rule of law, and caring for Mother Earth. Republicans apparently have stopped adhering to these principles and have succumbed to the dark side -- greed, hatred, and ignorance."

US:186567305,I want democracy to be protected.
US:163771991,The republican party is doing more to address issues that will increase quality of life for citizens and democrats continue to attack values I consider important in order to do whatever the most self absorbed nonsense their is
US:4298513,"Because it seems that the Democrat party seems to not care about regular Americans. They care more about illegal immigrants, trans male athletes and lied about President Biden. In reality I just think current republicans have more common sense."
US:134501701,I believe in helping the people who are in the middle class and under. I believe in taxing the billionaires and I believe in abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
US:1663994,"I don’t believe in murdering babies, don’t think sexual preference should give anyone special rights, totally against illegal immigrations, and will not go to El Salvador to bring an ElSavadorian citizen, who was in America illegally, back to America, so he can be deported again!

US:33751451,Because I believe more in their views
US:168194249,I am not a sheep and will not accept everything because of the party. The Democrats are lost and the Republican's do not seem to be able to think for themselves (hence they follow an Authoritarian who does not seem to be very bright).
US:155978515,"Because my concerns are not the same as the democratic party. I cannot understand why Democrats seem to wanna keep terrorist, illegal, immigrant, murderers, rapists in our country. And why is it that when Democrats don't like something they riot."
US:177687425,I believe in truth through the Bible. I don't believe in being mean or taking sides each issue should be looked at accordingly in what the real truth
US:41089265,I don't totally agree with either side.
US:144916515,I’m left-leaning and progressive
US:4646770,They align with my values and views
US:42339906,conservative principles
US:39444385,"Because the current batch of Republicans is absolutely insane and they don't care about the American people, only money."
US:1407512,"I share many views with the pre-Trump Republican Party with respect to free markets and personal liberty; I find practically nothing in common with the current MAGA populist Republicans and the left-wing Democratic ideologues controlling most of the blue states and blue cities who all want to censor speech they don‘t like, curtail free trade, and generally try to control too much of people’s lives while being totally ineffective at providing basic services."
US:25724390,I enjoy freedoms

US:23759088,I believe in helping the common person.
US:41270664,I was raised in a democratic household. And was taught to help neighbors and those less fortunate. Republicans are only out for themselves
US:2223213,"Democrats tend to be Idiots. Eg., the whole 'MD man' idiocy in the news. The Dems are pushing back in this because it's the only topic/issue they have! Also, the male trans vs women/girls in sports. These are both common sense issues!"
US:1164292,"I believe in law and order. I believe immigration is only for those that legal come to the USA. I believe in a strong military and police force to keep the peace.

US:2128938,I support the issues that Trump is trying to work on.
US:144724117,I believe the constitution should be enforced and businesses should not be given a vote. Big money should not be allowed to lobby for votes or fund campaigns.

US:679060,I'm for lower taxes and less spending
US:29765841,"The Democrat Party has moved sharply left over the years, and are now mostly radical in their social viewpoints and oddly unwilling to work with moderates even in their own party. I believe that many moderate Democrats will leave the party as Independents"
US:39866820,Republican views and policies align mush closer with Biblical teachings.
US:40454774,Listen to both sides of any issue..BE WELL INFORMED.. Pray before you vote.
US:127970477,"I believe in keeping more of what I earn, and that we are subsidizing bad behavior which leads to poverty."
US:3807435,"I agree with the policies of the Democratic party. While not perfect, the Democrats are so much better in every way than those greedy, disgusting republicans. They are too busy lining up to kiss Trump's ass to get anything done."

US:138884291,"I think their on my side of the game. I think they're fighting an evil that needs to be or must be stopped in their tracks. I think they are the only way forward toward peace and prosperity for all. I think they are the most fair for everybody by far. They seem to believe totally more with the side of real people, not people that already have all the wealth and will do anything to get all the rest of it. There does seem to be some framework of order in this political party and it starts with or is filled with very good value, morals and an understanding of those in the most need. They are smart, they understand all of the problems and which ones should be addressed first, second and so on. I like to be on the side that wants to help everybody and not see anybody suffer for a lifetime, under the rule of others that hide behind steel cells, steel cuffs, a way of doing things that doesn't allow for anybody else to do anything and other things that only let them succeed. I guess what I'm saying is, I like fairness and I see that in great abundance with this particular party."

US:3273277,Common sense. The extreme left of the Democrat party has taken over the party. They no longer represent the average people of their party. Elizabeth Warren has moved so far to the extreme left that she doesn’t connect with the people. Bernie Sanders has gone completely off and no longer represents the real Democrat party. He is so far left the he is a Socialist who a too close to becoming a Communist. The Democrat party needs to split into two parties. The extreme left needs to leave the Democrat party so the Democrat party can rebuild itself to meet the needs/wishes of the true Democrats.

What else would any American choose but to be a democrat if they have any care for our country?"
US:31628241,"Through most of my life, the Democrats more closely advocate for the policies and practices that I most closely believe in. But there are some things that Republicans support, that could be incorporated into the platform as well. That is why I call myself a moderate. I am not at either extreme, or decisively one or the other."
US:142914069,I believe more in the republicans views

I believe women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. I believe in climate change and that more needs to be done to combat its effects. I believe all people regardless of sexual affiliation, are entitled to marry. And the fact that the GOP rallied around the racist, sexist, xenophobic, convicted felon moron Trump again (esp after his disastrous first term) is disgraceful. Makes me ashamed to be living in a country that allowed him to be president again."

US:189920859,"because i don't subscribe to the two party system. I think views and opinions are nuanced and can't be housed in just two camps - Red and Blue. I have views/opinions that span both, that disagree with both and some that are disagreed on by both parties as well. I just think we need to do away with blind party allegiance and vote for politicians for their character, stance on policy, and their ability to listen and be an advocate for their constituency and not the lobbyists and corporations or the 1%."
US:26589211,"Being fiscally conservative, which means balancing the budget (an historic impossiblity for poorly motivated congressman and women-as time has proven), I support the idea of less government. Does this make me a conservative with a large or small 'c'? To do otherwise is to flirt with all the typical high budget-high inflation problems of Third World countries such as Milei's problems in Argentina. Growing Local, County, State, and Federal bureaucracies are exactly where many people hope to be employed. Is this real productivity or just sand in the gears?"
US:196798879,I lean more towards the conservative ideals of the Republican Party.

US:29962104,Politicians in general lie cheat and look out for themselves. ON BOTH SIDES.
US:39178274,Moral issues
US:3790214,"Both parties have strengths and weaknesses. It's important to do what is the best interest of the nation, not a political party or a leader who makes impulsive, unsearched decisions. Political promises are like water in a sieve, empty!"

US:118883263,none they dont care
US:1205565,"Because the current republican party is looking out for all people in the USA. For example, trying to get illegal immigrants out of our country. That's good for everybody. All I see from the democratic party is obstruction at the cost of common sense. All the democrats want is power at all costs while their policies are destructive to the constitution!"
US:121448459,"Republicans lie all the time, are far too extreme, and are also extremely corrupt. Plus they are a cult who's only concern is pleasing Donald Trump. At least the democrats are authoritarians."
US:32323765,"I believe that people should be respected; they should believe in the country that they live in, fly its flag and respect its laws. They should try to assimilate and become cohesive instead of living in cliques together."
US:44105911,I believe what they stand for
US:29291320,"They are slightly less corrupt. They are more concerned with human rights. Proof is how trump is handling they are deporting people they brand as criminals with no evidence, no chance of proving their innocence and that includes people who are legal citizens. And deporting them to prisons in other countries with NO DUE PROCESS WHATSOEVER and then lying and not following Supreme Court orders."
US:180644843,I was a Democrat before the progressive crap.
US:32255549,"Because the Republican Party has basically given itself over to fascism. It doesn't leave a lot of room for folks like me, but the Democratic Party hasn't done that, hence why I stick with them."

US:193097287,"Currently the Democrats are more interested in yelling, screaming, and cutting the current the administration down. They are more interested in spreading ill conceived possible laws. They need to work. Imagine the outcry if the Republicans refused to work with the Democrats and did nothing. Not another would be elected again.. They are the ones who are doing their job at this time."

US:24934839,always been one
US:40985165,"I am a former Republican, now vehemently anti-Trump. Under Joe Biden, our post-covid economy and our relations with other countries were repaired.

Democrats are generally more willing to acknowledge nuances, ""gray areas,"" and not stubbornly cling to a ""black and white"" view."
US:786572,"Independent, but the Republican Party is definitely more Conservative."
US:29288173,The Democratic party's stand on issues is closest to my position.

US:156099709,"After weighing the 2 sides, I felt that being a Republican was a better choice for me."
US:169009619,Because at the end of the day both parties work to gain power for themselves and keep that power. They are two sides of the same coin. I’m not closer to either side as I try to be not of this system.
US:116199799,"I was a staunch Democrat for most of my adult life and a union member. I was kind of center in most of my beliefs but the democrats seemed to more be in line with my values. Then they started to come after my guns and I began leaning towards the right and then they started wanting more rights for pregnant women and had no regard for the voiceless children and I leaned farther right. Then as a state employee whose union supported our democrat governor I watched as he adopted the same position regarding our union as the republican candidate and I began to vote republican. Then the affirmative action came and I as a management employee of the state was forced to hire not the best candidates for the job but minority candidates and I was required to stay within a strict budget while dropping my current suppliers of many different items and replacing them with other suppliers who sold the same products but at budget shattering inflated prices from minority owned businesses and I realized that the democrats were not about equality but about a whole different agenda and it kept getting worse to the point that I could no longer consider myself a centered democrat or even a right leaning one because the center line for me was so far to the right that I had no choice especially because it's only gotten worse with gays having special rights that I as a heterosexual don't have or minorities getting special treatment even though they are hardly a minority anymore and I couldn't understand why we didn't have equal rights anymore but specialized rights. The gun laws they keep proposing make it harder for me to get a weapon or ammunition to defend myself while they cry to defund the police so I can be defenseless and the bar keeps getting lowered in areas such as faith and abortion, the government in the hands of the left was leaning towards totalitarianism and I stopped recognizing my country anymore as they weakened our military and opened our borders and then told me there's more than two genders and our fucking sex was assigned at birth and we could change it at will contrary to the science they propose to support. That's why I am a registered republican and I consider myself a conservative because the few values I share with the liberals are not even considered left leaning any longer. I could write a book about it but my overpriced expired bacon that I got from the dumpster of my local supermarket where the blue haired gender fluid chick with a dick who was getting paid $20 an hour to take out the garbage chased me away because it was better that I should starve to protect its rights than for me to eat there fucking garbage."
US:45367185,Until the election of twenty sixteen I was a registered independent voter. When trump won that year I switched democratic. I will do anything to help keep trump at bay.

US:111635659,They have more ideas on issues that I align with

US:3881007,Conservations
US:4608932,Because I want to take care of people as a whole and not just look out for myself. We need to band together to take care of the masses.
US:492685,I think of myself as a Democrat because that's how I've been voting and because the Democratic party is more truthful than the republicans. Democrats get things done the right way.
US:189121583,Less government in your life
US:136574059,"It is the party most closely aligned with my values: data driven decision making, support for science, progressive society."
US:40099643,Brought up with there views. Less Government spending. Gun rights. Lower taxes.
US:629518,"Democrats as a group are more focused on identity politics and attacking President Trump than on doing what's best for the country. Republicans on the whole are more patriotic, more supportive of law enforcement and the military, and make a point of empathizing with crime victims rather than with the criminals and illegals."
US:1594647,Because I am not a Nazi or a facists which is what the GOP has become. They are the party of treason.
US:189919687,As I've gotten older that's just the way I lean.
US:2726755,It’s generational.
US:175596559,I believe everyone under age 62 should have a job.
US:128975543,The most important issues to me are protecting the environment and protecting public education and my views align closer to democrats on those issues. I disagree with democrats on a lot of other issues but I disagree with republicans on a lot of issues as well.
US:39750116,"I am a fixed income senior citizen. Democrats don't have a clue what I might go through. Republicans at least are interested in helping me, just not trying to tell me how to live like democrats seem to like to do."
US:134860915,I’m not a racist
US:135122513,They vote for things that help the working class like Social Security Health care drugs and education
US:3486428,"I believe Democrats stand for helping those who are in need of assistance, with housing, food , child care and more..I believe republicans have lost sight of what America is supposed to represent!!"
US:23979976,Because I believe that the regular people are not represented by other parties
US:1583424,most demon policies are about how they can control everyone so they can stay in power
US:165262967,The republicans are working towards answers as I do.
US:28155774,"I have officially left the party due to Donald Trump and the MAGA maggots. I have been a Republican since I was 18 and left the party after January 6th and the farce. I am a Republican, not a MAGA maggot (there is a difference), at heart as I believe in small government, hand-ups not hand-0uts and fiscal responsibility."
US:185482491,Because I'm not a moonbat or communist
US:3170006,"I have always been aligned with the ideals as stated in the Democratic platform and been mostly opposed to the garbage the Republicans spout. I see the Democratic Party more as followers of the Christ and the Republicans as the worst sinners in the world. Democrats help people, Republican hurt people."
US:160334763,I agree more with the Republican agenda than the Democratic agenda. My biggest concern with the Republican agenda is the issue of abortion. It should be legal in every state of the US.
US:40545201,"I believe in the freedom of our country, the people having rights, women being able to control their bodies. NOT having a rapist in the most important job of our country paying off and threatening everyone that goes against his will like Hitler in 1939. Please remember JANUARY 6TH"
US:29307812,I am closer to the Republican party not because of the policies they support but because the democratic party has shifted so far to the left I can no longer support them in the majority of their policies.
US:146615915,"The Democratic Party has always represented the things that I believe in. In the current situation, the Republicans are ruled by Trump, and are being required to “kiss his ass“ — his own words."
US:40927810,Like the conservative way.
US:486778,"I believe in the best for ALL the American people not what is best for fringe groups, gender, skin color."
US:177660621,I prefer the goal of democrats to increase or maintain public projects and services.
US:46500960,"I have carefully considered the candidates and issues since before I was old enough to vote, in the 1980s, in every election. My main deciding issues have been about environmental issues, and humane issues. In high school, we would compare the actual voting records of those in the legislature, to how we ourselves would vote on bills. In the 1980s, this led to me mostly being aligned decidedly more often with Democratic Party candidates. Since the 1980s, there have not been many Republican environmentalist candidates. Since the turn of the century, the Republican Party has become more and more insane and, well, blatantly mendacious and stupid, and in 2025, seems to be attempting a neo-Nazi fascist coup of sorts. That doesn't make me forget that the Democratic Party is still also largely in the pocket of megadonors, but it does rule out any support I might have considered for Republicans at this point."
US:178605411,The Republican Party has become far too conservative and I don’t like that they want to exclude certain groups of people.
US:30629352,Republicans tend to be more conservative and old fashioned

US:28221668,I believe in freedom and democracy for all.
US:160277593,The Republican party mostly supports the Constitution. The Democrats support their party power over the good of the country.
US:4659628,"My values and priorities are aligned with those of the Republican party. I want smaller more efficient government. I live in CA, a Dem stronghold and I detest it. Dems who want illegal criminals to stay in the US, they want men in women's locker rooms, etc is just disgusting to me. Republicans do not want these types of policies."
US:126891685,not sure
US:196553449,In part because the conservative side of the political spectrum has started using an echo chamber to create a huge divide in our country and the policies that these politicians and people are putting forward goes against my values such as anti-LGBTQ+ laws and trying to remove our history from being taught to younger generations.
US:2249522,"Dems are extreme, supporting issues I do not agree with and have lost common sense. I’m closer to the Rep party because they’ve managed to stay less controversial"
US:2762577,I tend to be more pragmatic on social issues and fiscally conservative which aligns better with republicans
US:128048393,I don't favor either party one more than the other... I vote for the party that best meets my political interest and promotes what's best for America...
US:2657787,"Because the values of service to the people and provide Basic needs to everyone, rule of law, freedom of speech and providing access and opportunities to all resonates with me. Democratic policies are inclusive, Republican policies are exclusive focusing more of keeping people out."
US:155040945,"Because republican policies are antithetical to the ethos of aiding the collective; I believe billionaires should not exist; I think that climate change is among the most important issues of our time; I believe in public education and in the Accessibility of higher education, not as vocational training but for making better people and a stronger citizenry. I Would not, however, call myself a democrat, because they are closer to republicans. We live in a right wing nation and it sucks."
US:25627194,Because I have a brain and love my country. Demonrats hate the United States.
US:168557029,"I am an ""old school"" Republican and do not agree with very much if the current ""faux Republicans"" in office. The party used to stand for safeguarding our freedom and incomes, reducing government waste, enforcing the rule of law, and supporting the US Constitution. The current regime seems to only be interested in bettering themselves rather than the people and the government they are supposed to serve and being subservient to a man who has proven to have no interests except his own."
US:447766,I lean toward the left on most social issues which aligns more with the Democrats. I am pretty conservative about fiscal matters and neither party is very good at budget balancing.
US:40647715,"I believe in small government - doing more with less. I believe in democracy, the rule of law, the right to self defence, severe punishment and the death penalty."

US:810851,"As a former Republican, the values of the current Democratic Party align more closely with those I have held for the past 65 years. The fact of the matter is there is no longer a Republican Party; it has become the party of Trump, the ultimate RINO."
US:144121255,I couldn't imagine being a Republican.
US:40853098,"I'm a conservative republican, I'm not looking down my nose to make you feel bad for your views. Babies are babies at conception. This that don't think our military has a hard job, need to be mad to go thru boot camp. Anyone over the age of 18 but less than 65 of they are on welfare they should be made to work and pay back some of the monies spent on them. We live in America, learn our language, be proud to be an American. If you left your home to come here don't try to change this nation into what you left.

US:174861947,Because I care for ppl. And I agree a lot of what they stand for
US:194148603,Because I agree with more issues that with the Republicans
US:1259356,I think that I'm a good American that believes that democracy is threatened terribly. The Mango Musselini is destroying our great country and is being run over rough shod! I believe being a Democrat is the voice of reason!
US:40709435,Because I feel Trump fights for us to be free. To be able to speak your mind on whatever subject you're talking about.to protect yourself from harm. To eat what we want even if we can't afford it.

US:42299522,Equity
US:113566757,I am a libertarian. I registered as a Republican years ago because of Ron Paul. The Democratic party has lost its mind. I would register as almost anything to avoid being associated with the Democrats.
US:204036509,The gop is extremely dangerous and as a progressive democrat we need to get rid of the corrupt politicians and vote in politicians who will fight for the people instead of the rich

US:24922006,I believe in democracy. I believe in the truth and telling it! I believe in equal rights and so do the democrats. I believe in fairness and rule of law!
US:43686628,"Primarily because the Republican Party has sold out to a narcissist who only cares about his wealth and the power required to maintain it. In general, I am an ""Eisenhower/Obama"" moderate: liberal on social issues such as DEI and economic safety nets; moderate on economic issues like taxes and federal regulations that govern locally controlled services; and and conservative on issues of national security and international relations. Under the current circumstances, I don't have an option other than the Democratic Party."
US:25858314,I feel that they're the best at keeping some things just for the low income
US:162527131,they are both wrong
US:29646601,The republicans are sociopaths and the democrats are pussies who can’t string a single coherent sentence together.
US:185648487,Because I cannot see anything that I'd ever vote for that is democratic anymore ...
US:137243677,The Democrats are off the rails. They were for defunding the police; now they are supporting gang members and criminals. They have perverted the court system and use it against all their enemies. It really appears they are working to destroy the country.
US:32902427,i'm not conservative
US:127227671,I think both parties are beholden to the oligarchy and both parties need to listen to the people and tax the rich

US:2965399,Don’t agree with either on all issues
US:195198509,Republicans are the party that I share the most values with and have the most in common with. I could never be a democrat I don't agree with much of anything they believe in.
US:116029959,because both parties have different views and agendas that can be good and bad
US:176631615,I follow along the Republican line of values.
US:425544,"While the Democratic party is far from perfect (and keeps playing by a rulebook the GOP has long since thrown out), the IDEALS of the party mostly align with mine. The Democrats believe in equity and fairness, in compassion, education, science, and multiculturalism. They are against cruelty. Whether individuals have greed or land differently on specific issues (Israel/Palestine, Sudan, Armenia), the party as a whole looks toward progress, not authoritarianism and racism, misogyny, power, control, and fearmongering."
US:193783697,I don't pay any attention to politics
US:121236665,Because Republicans only think of themselves whereas Democrats think mostly for the people
US:1104638,"The Democratic Party has become to self righteous, and progressively idealistic. imposing their beliefs to the extent that they infringe on others who differ from them. They denied the party a Primary to choose their candidate, used the government to censor people, covered up for Biden's mental decline and his families unethical businesses, dismissed parents rights, created a disaster at the boarder.. The party generally seems to get nothing meaningful accomplished. They until people by anger and basically can't seem to articulate what it is exactly they want for our country."
US:33985798,"Many of my political decisions revolve around protecting the family unit. I find that republican values tend to reflect my own, most of the time."

US:1861261,"Republicans are evil, vile, murderers under the guise of Christianity, power hungry, money comes before Humanity. I would never ever make those my priorities. Peace equality and justice for every human is the Democratic way if you boil them both down to the bones."
US:206719687,It's the party that values my life as a woman and values choice to live authentically. It values LGBTQ+ lives and isn't racist.
US:1004230,"I have the same believes, morals"
US:170060187,"I grew up poor and female. From the time I could reason, it seemed to me that Republicans favor people with lots of money and white males. They're not fair to everybody and I have been one of the ones that are not fair to."
US:191010049,"Neither party stands for true freedom of the individual. I cherish my Second Amendment rights just as much as I champion abortion rights and LGBTQ+ freedom of expression. Both parties are all talk, and looking out for the interests of the Rich instead of the People."

US:195684765,I agree with the Democratic Party's political views.
US:4276471,"Because the GOP has turned into a self-serving, lawless, greed driven, infantile group of authoritarian incompetents willfully locked in a cult of personality against the rest of the world who they can't measure up to. Democrats, for all their faults - and there are many - truly are the only hope for regular people - if only they, who never seem to be able to shut up, could figure out how to bloody articulate that!"
US:41959357,"I believe in personal freedom and responsibility, small government, safe borders, parental rights, strong military, and reducing wasteful government spending."

US:191886335,"I believe in democracy. I believe in equality for all people no matter of gender, race, religion. I want universal healthcare and a living wage for everyone. Corporations are not people and the rich should pay more in taxes than the middle class. Trump and his rigged cabinet and Supreme Court should be in jail."
US:4016996,"Donald Trump has reshaped the Republican party into a common sense party that fights the uniparty Washington BS. Dems are for open borders, allowing men into womens spaces and every fringe radical idea that defies actual reality and common sense. Also men can't be women or vice versa."

US:170694857,I believe in very small government and America First.

US:28545819,I grew up in a democratic household and have always believed that way.
US:2845092,l believe in the constitutiion and not the idiotic ideas of the current Dem party and their crooked left wing. The Dem party-nothing but a bunch of thieves. Some Republicans also but my party is the better choice. President Trump believes the ideals I have. If I could voted for him again I WOULD.
US:184380269,I don't follow politics. I don't even know the difference between the two parties
US:140438759,"I believe politicians are supposed to serve the people who voted them in office, not special interest groups. I believe there should be a limit on how much money individuals and special interest groups as well as corporations are allowed to spend on elections."
US:30548187,"Because I disagree greatly over Democratic's stances on most things. They are untrustworthy, cheats, liars, & murderers (looking at YOU, Clintons). I agree wtih what Donald Trump has done thus far, even if it means a temporary increase in items for now. Hoping when the tariff wars are over, prices will calm down a bit. However, right now, things are tough. I gotta keep the faith. After the election, I changed my voter registration party from a lifetime Democrat to Republican. Can't be happier over that choice."
US:137107989,"I learned as a young person to study the issues and learn as much as I could about candidates. As a result, I tend to vote, based upon issues and policy statements, rather than personality, and this is why I have sometimes voted for a Republicans, sometimes voted for Democrats. Unfortunately, both Democrats and Republicans have become extremely out of touch with the people of our nation. They are self involved narcissists. Some people on the right are outright fascists, and it seems as if Republican members of Congress are full-blown members of the cult or just totally afraid to speak out about what is right. I believe that I will continue to be an independent but voting out our current Republican “leaders” has become an urgent necessity."
US:379140,"Because I believe in giving everybody a fair shot, not just white males, and I think only one party in this country actually upholds the Constitution. I also think we are now an oligarchy and strong measures need to be taken to correct that"
US:199356391,"I believe in the pre-Trump Republican ideas of robust foreign policy, limited government intrusion in social issues, and small government. I believe in having each branch stay in its lane, so that the legislature legislates, not rule by executive order, and the judiciary interprets the Constitution, not the president and unelected billionaires."

US:24918889,it is the best fit for my more conservative beliefs
US:1090673,"i am a democrat because there is no party further left. Democrats are too corporate and too beholden to wealth, but they are much closer to my beliefs and desires for people and this country now and in the future. Moving into the future, getting results that are further left - more humane and more equitable - with more and stronger rights for all - will be easier to attain with Democrats in power because they are already closer to my beliefs. Pushing Dems left is a shorter move than pushing Republicans left"
US:182494365,"The Republican Party no longer exists, it’s become a very dangerous cult"
US:125411221,because the democratic party isn't as far to the right as the Republicans
US:678250,Because the democrates have lost their minds.
US:193032487,"Because I resonate with the Democratic values of social justice, equity, and inclusivity.

Abortion is a choice between the woman and her doctor, not the government."
US:127405769,agree with them more on most issues although not completely
US:28702002,"I have been a Republican since I was in my late twenties. That is because Republicans believe in common sense regarding issues affecting people.

US:24990557,"I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative, and i dont think theres a party for that. But it doesn't really matter because corporations have bought the government and the two sides are each just as ""bought"" as the other. The current republican party is trying to turn the US into Gilead from The Handmaid's Tale while speedrunning our economic destruction and democrats just sit quietly and take their corporate bribes--er, ""donations."" Neither party is anything i want to be a part of."

US:948564,i agree with them most of the time

The last two generations have lost their way, and greed has taken over their minds. This transgender issue cannot be condoned because it goes against nature. One’s mind cannot decide what their gender it is, your DNA and genital parts define that. Thank goodness, the illegal immigration issue is being addressed. We have permitted strong enemies of our country to enter and flourish, which will aid in America’s collapse from within."

Unfortunately our government has accrued massive debts that with either need to be repaid with inflated, worthless, dollars, or repudiated which would cause global financial chaos. There is massive waste and inefficiency in government; in general it needs to do less. By doing less, it will allow many diverse experiments in living to thrive."
US:22719889,"BOTH SUPPORT IMPERIALISM, WHITE DELUSION, CAPITALISM, WHICH I OPPOSE"

US:126998419,I have very conservative values and do not align on anything with democrats
US:947883,"The party of Common Sense! Republican Party stands for God,Country, Family! Democrats Party, is on the wrong side of everything!

US:46469720,"The Democrats and Republicans are just two different wings on the same corporate Oligarch bird. Neither party does what's right for The People. They've all made millions of dollars on insider trading. Their allegiance is to the Billionaires, not real Americans. I stopped being a Democrat when the DNC rigged the 2016 primary against Bernie Sanders and he didn't sue them. He was winning the Primary and had momentum, and he didn't pursue his campaign as an Independent. I sent Bernie $1200 and he didn't fight for himself, he just dropped out like the coward.

She answered by saying, ""Republicans are for big business, Democrats are for the people."" I decided I wanted to be a Democrat from that time on. I believe in the principles and beliefs that Democrats do. I'm very liberal, leaning towards a leftist, so being a Democrat just works for me.

US:26414137,A person that believes in not overspending. Believes in law and order
US:138614005,I think both parties have died and neither has a future. The things the parties agree on are far worse than the things they disagree about.
US:41262339,I think of myself as a Republican because I am conservative in how I think and how I live and my values are similar to Republicans.
US:40498402,There is nothing I agree with the modern democrat party about.

US:40637985,Against ALL things Republicans stand for!
US:184756041,I'm not crazy and they're not as crazy as the other party.
US:1457123,"Career politicians are liars, cheats and thieves. Political parties are huge collections of the same. Their so called “platforms” are bullshit, just pandering to the diverse groups of freaks they’re trying to get to vote for them. No current political party in the US is worthy of my membership. Most of them should be banned and the members put in jails."
US:22650534,I do not subscribe to group think
US:3053506,Republicans have broken their oaths to protect the Constitution and obey the rule of law to impose a Tyrannical Dictator to rule over the people in a fascist nazi state. Some are just cowards hopping to keep a do nothing job.

US:173035613,"I am against any government or institution that utilizes punishment and coercion or even the voice of the ""majority"" to force their will upon another. All social contracts should be VOLUNTARY."
US:24653070,"There are at least a few Republicans that still believe in Constitutional principles, liberty, and responsible governance.

US:41404730,"Democrats are all about taking care of everyone, no mater the race, ethnicity, or sex. I feel the very same way. That’s why I support the Democratic Party and will continue to.

US:1847773,Both sides have major flaws in their platforms and nominees for all elected offices. It's hard to back such flawed policies.
US:40966639,"Republicans stand most closely with my moral beliefs. In 2025, Republicans are the ones willing to do what needs to be done to save our country. We are technically bankrupt financially and morally as a country and need to change to still have a country. People need to understand that change takes time as do the benefits of change. If in this moment, the government does not make some drastic changes, there will be no America."

US:41950005,"I am very objective on any given topic, political or otherwise. The parties are too partisan and run by activists with agendas. I vote the candidate not party affiliation. Currently the Democrats have gone too far to the Left , hence my voting Republican recently. Not that the Republicans haven't gone too far right in the past."
US:3179729,"No party is perfect, but Republicans have completely sold out to big-money interests, and to extremists on policies such as LGBTQ rights, abortion, immigration, the police state, etc. They are all about hurting people, and cruelty, not about helping people. Democrats aren't perfect, but they aren't nearly this bad."
US:199456005,They are the party of common sense and morals now. The Democrats are all insane.
US:188024727,I have found lately that I tend to agree more with the ideals of the republicans as opposed to those of the democrats in office
US:164847649,Not a fan of giving my money away for stupid stuff
US:4415494,I am very conservative and do not believe in the philosophy of the democrats
US:201365193,More safe
US:123050029,"Because I used to be a Republican but the Republicans have become spineless, bigoted, fascist wannabes led by a lying , morally reprehensible nitwit who cares only for the rich and shameless."
US:186486389,"The Democrats and Republicans lie, cheat and steal from the American people. They are out for themselves."

US:4637688,I agree and disagree with both on certain issues
US:31529702,Honesty.
US:33082158,"Allegiance to a political party over allegiance to democracy as a whole, is ignorant, unAmerican and self-defeating. Our Republic was built on compromise; partisan politics gives preference to “party first,” promotes constant partisan warfare and gridlock, and abhors understanding and agreement/consensus."
US:1576216,I have common sense
US:138975121,I think of myself as a Democrat because my family has always voted for Democrats. Even now I vote for Democrats. I just feel that I can trust that the individual selected will serve in the best interest of the American people.
US:22711524,I don't know
US:2836299,I think of myself as a democrat because I believe women should make decisions about their own body.
US:1173927,both parties have some good and some bad qualities
US:439322,believe in being conservative
US:142262169,democrats care about others and trying to make things better for everyone through progress. democrats want to increase the ability to vote and protect our rights instead of taking them away.
US:196624341,I believe in God and want His laws followed. I also am against abortion and illegal immigration.
US:193574135,"I believe in freedoms and the rights of others to have autonomy over their body, separation of church and state, and the value of all people. The distressing pivot in Republican politics led me to leave the party a decade ago, and I never regretted it."
US:3588683,"Belief in America first as it should be all Americans desire. One must be loyal to their nation and always strive to allow freedom and liberty to its citizens, first and foremost. The GOp certainly adheres to this policy whereas the Dems are nothing more than psuedo communists today."
US:164401853,I think that both parties are extreme and refuse to compromise for the benefit of the nation.
US:160843631,I think some of their principles are better
US:184430155,Trustworthy and obedience
US:2767720,Because there don't keep their word.
US:545303,Republicans generally understand that we have a constitutional republic not a pure democracy. It is through the election process that we choose the people to govern us. They are elected for specific terms to represent their constituents.
US:23085882,I’m for putting America first and getting rid of the fraud and misspending of our tax money.
US:173707059,I think of myself as closer to a libertarian. The republican party is closer to libertarianism than the demcratic party. I strongly oppose men in women’s sports but fully support their right to dress however they wish. This is a big deal for me as a woman. I also feel like the democratic party has become the party of oppression. Racial oppression all the way through to suppression of free speech.
US:4479363,I don't understand politics
US:193643485,I am a Republican because Republicans are for the people and not for themselves.
US:30858680,"Believe in the constitution, due process fairly applied to all, freedom from religion, protecting the environment, protecting our allies as needed and respecting everyone. This ain't happening with the current administration."
US:160868747,They are ever so technically more liberal.
US:165606295,"I've been raised as one, and won't stray from my beliefs."
US:202992795,"I believe individual liberty is paramount. I want low taxes, hiring based on merit not skin color, the right to defend myself and my family, an end to illegal immigration."
US:148829553,The two party system sucks and I want no part of it.
US:40992770,"Because it's the party of common sense. The Democrats have gone way too far left with trans crap, socialistic ideas, and, it appears, disdain for religion, Christians specifically, and they continually want to spend, spend, spend, putting the country deeper and deeper in debt."
US:164408309,My values align with and have always been very traditional republican.
US:4707932,"I am social liberal with the notion that we can take care of people through fiscal conservatism(money going to social programs, education, infrastructure, arts, the environment, etc) rather then the military. I am PRO Palestine. I am progressive, I am FREe speech and PRO Choice with no waivers. I have a lot of Libertarian tendencies and I NEVER ever vote Republican. Once with Reagan and then I woke up and yes I am Woke!"
US:177711051,I can freely say and do what I think.
US:30765801,they have more policies that align with my point of view
US:1383239,Most aligned with my political beliefs

US:184845317,I don’t agree with the MAGA movement in the Republican Party.
US:108973657,Party of my beliefs
US:150244015,I think of myself as a Democrat because they care about the poor and the middle class. They care about healthcare and taking care of people in the US and helping the poor in other nations.
US:1898649,Because they enforce the law and not allow millions of people to come here illegally
US:161076101,My stances on policies align more closely with the Democratic party
US:182074297,Because I am not a Democrat. Do not agree with Democrat policies.
US:3183682,"I don't believe the Democrats get to choose what someone's fair share is. If you didn't earn it, you're not entitled to it."
US:3940658,"Their morals and values align better with my beliefs. Republicans are more concerned with the state of our country, its finances, immigration issues and things that better everyone. Democrats are more concerned with issues that should be private and individuals over everybody rights and special or minority groups should have more rights than the majority of the country. Its a clear divide and I choose to try to better our country and cost of living rather than glorify individuals for airing their private matters and getting special rights and privileges because they choose a same sex relationship or mutilate their bodies. It really offends me to have anyone's sex life or genital mutilation constantly shoved in everybody's faces. Good Lord, they have the same rights as everyone and treated just like everyone else and now that isn't good enough and they want to raise themselves up to be better than the majority. Stand for my country and its future or stand with individuals that have been set on destroying our children, our country, our government and our president because they are more"" important"" than everyone else and we have to edit how we speak and live to accomdate them because they chose an alternate life style and easily offended over EVERYTHING? Think I am exaggerating? Choose a social media and just read people's comments on posts. How can any sane human would choose Republicans over Democrats?"
US:29364053,The Dems are out of control and lost touch with the real people
US:604330,"Beliefs of Strong Nation. Protect the Rule of Law. Convict criminals. Don't have tons of ""programs"" when perfectly able bodies can WORK. Stop all these giveaway programs. Reduce Gov't. Fight corruption in Demoncrates. Fight ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. Strong Borders."
US:28798069,Anti Trump
US:28717657,"I'm fiscally conservative, I desire ""small"" government, I desire ""law & order"""
US:2451194,Both major partied represent the rich
US:495733,"Because I see what current Republicans are doing, and it terrifies me. We are on the verge of losing our Democracy. And current Republicans are going along with it."
US:1242234,"In the current political system, they’re the most aligned with what I want to happen of parties that stand any chance."
US:144387771,All for steady change
US:41727303,"I think we should have the govt to help us.. not baby us. I am pro life, pro israel, No wars, Secure borders, Fair tariffs etc"
US:167065531,"I don't necessarily think of myself as a Democrat as much as I think of myself as a responsible citizen who wants our government to work for the people and not for big money donors, corporations and special interests. The government should do what it can to help and benefit the most people and improve lives."
US:1938898,I agree with more democrats
US:2041073,I am a Reagan Republican. Small government and no handouts.
US:4522696,I grew up that way and believe in their policies.
US:2255654,democrats are crooks and cheat in elections and republicans let them get away with it
US:173852127,"Im more conservative in my personal values and I strongly believe in smaller government,government being fiscally responsible and government not telling me what type of vehicle I can drive"
US:46357834,I’m actually mostly aligned with the Green Party
US:211933,Christian conservative
US:4502590,they are for the working class
US:124360063,Neither of both
US:200005395,Republicans are too conservative and do not align with common people and they lack empathy. While democrats are not the best but they are lesser of the two evil.
US:28870860,"I changed to a Democrat just 2 years ago. I feel strongly about their platform and viewpoints. Women’s rights, equality, I just agree with the Democrats so much more."
US:315327,It’s the most closest to what I believe in and more conservative
US:181620969,I believe that the republicans are making a mess of our government and allowing the president to play at being a dictator.
US:185729119,"I think of myself as a Democrat because I care about people, and I do not believe that Republicans care about regular people. They say they are Christians, but do not act that way. They don't want to help the poor or feed the hungry. Republicans are hypocrites. They only use the word God to get elected, and then they don't do anything for others. I am a Christian and I do not support LGBTQ or abortion. However, those are individual sins, and I cannot control how others live. God gave us free will. At least the Democrats do the Christian thing and help those who need it, support healthcare for all, and provide assistance to the needy. They even protect those whom Republicans see as sinners. God doesn't allow for us to treat others badly just because we disagree with them."
US:186087733,"Because the republican party has actively worked against minorities and to suppress voters' rights, as well as roll back environmental protection bills."
US:825399,"Most of what I believe is just the opposite from what the Democrats believe i.e. abortions, number of immigrants let into the country per year, D.E.I., and I could go on."
US:40911565,I believe in a very small Federal government. Political decisions should be more localized.
US:3089433,because they believe in protecting the unborn
US:1217672,"Believe in helping my fellow citizen, the down trolled. Make America a more perfect union"
US:535260,"fiscally conservative, patriotic, freedom of speech, preservation of American values and Democracy"
US:3713838,"I care about more than myself...I'm a part of a whole, and if that whole doesn't do well, nobody does well."
US:46477496,Because it aligns with the values I grew up with
US:196067011,"I’m for a small federal government. I think most policies should be handled by the states. I am pro-life, believe in only two genders and do not believe in any kind of gender affirming treatment for minors. I believe in hard work and accountability to be successful, and I don’t believe that tax payers should have to pay for a bunch of unnecessary things across the globe."
US:141145117,Because
US:137137465,more liberal
US:133654167,"The Democratic Party has lost touch with the people. And it is called the Democratic Socialist Party, The Republicans are concerned with the people of this country and that is why I switched party's. They need to look back in history if they have a brain. It was the Whigs and the Democrats in the 1700s. The Whigs became too progressive and it was no longer a party. The it became the Democrats and the Republicans'."
US:202491319,They care more about working class people they are just horrible at messaging.
US:152076437,"Their positions are typically more conservative like mine, although they don't always stick to them as much as they should."
US:188653971,"Both parties talk a lot, but neither actually bother considering reality. Both parties only talk about superficial ideas, but don't actually bother to understand the details so that good decisions can be made."
US:37892153,The party is more in line with my views on the issues
US:187156745,"Government can help people all over the country, and allows to better our society and economy."
US:185084111,"There is so much I could say - volumes. Lately, I would have to say that EVERYTHING that Trump and MAGA are doing is constitutionally wrong. The marginalized are threatened by this scourge. I am actively involved in protests and rallies in my area."
US:1896915,"Business friendly, fewer regulations, no extreme views, more sane"
US:32917056,They align more with my beliefs than the democrats
US:31457539,Because Republicans are afraid of their President and his cult
US:39920672,I like points of view from both parties.
US:43405635,"I support a smaller government, less government handoffs , less restrictions on owning firearms, I think Trump is doing a great job and that DOGE is doing tremendous work and that we are safer as a nation with the illegals deported and Trump in charge"
US:864124,Their values align with mine more than the democrats
US:181192649,"The Democratic Party has lost its values, and is too extreme."
US:167619633,"I had been a lifelong Republican until tge 2016 presidential election. I did not like the course the GOP had been taking for a number of years, ignoring core issues which affect ordinary citizens' lives and wellbeing."
US:38614662,"Even though I've always been an Independent, many of my views align with those of Democratic politicians."

US:2287311,less radiical
US:1692904,"My positions on every issue align better with the Democrats than the Republicans, and until there is a viable party to theleft of the Democrats, I will be a Democrat."
US:184628065,"I vote for whom I think is best for the country. I want someone that thinks like the people. Most high up politicians are in it for the glory and money and don't care about the people. President Trump cares. He doesn't need the money or fame, he was already rich and famous. Why would he take on such a mess if he didn't love our country?"
US:170205401,Because I am for limited government and conservative values.
US:1327499,Because they more closely align with my views.
US:4499254,because they try to help the working class
US:42303195,"These parties have both lost their ways by being polarized. ""Compromising"" is a lost art in our congress."
US:1761344,For logical and sane policies
US:34430423,"While I have some agreement with both, they both parties have positions that I cannot support in any manner or form."
US:28901228,"I like things from each side. I also don't either side has it completely right, especially nowadays"
US:27241418,I think the Democratic party cares for a larger percentage of the American public.
US:176137045,I believe they are for all the people just not just the wealthy.

US:25916523,"I believe in morals, values and pride in my country"
US:188622063,"Government has gotten ridiculously too big. Their job mainly should be security! Not telling us what kind of car to drive or stove to cook on. I’m pro life and think government needs to shrink in size, reduce taxes and stop bleeding money!"
US:116835241,"It’s my way of protecting people, all people."
US:169862501,"Strong Military, National Defense. Safe Borders. Free Market. I do prefer capitalism over socialism. Parents Choice/School Choice."
US:40826094,Less government is better. The government cant do everything for us.
US:41061421,I care about people other than myself.
US:128228409,not sure
US:173180475,"Because people who subscribe to one side or the other seem to get lost and believe one side is “all wrong” or “all right”. “Republican”, “democrat”, “liberal”, “far-right”, etc., I see as labels that are divisive. You express certain views on a matter stating that you’re part of either of those groups, your viewpoint and voice are stifled if it’s not agreeable to what’s commonly or politically correct. You have freedom of speech until you say something someone doesn’t like. It’s an incredible challenge for us as people to have conversations or productive, healthy arguments, without involving emotions, misunderstanding one another, making assumptions and so on. It’s the same issue with religion. Identifying as a Christian people appear to chastise you for your religion, yet respect others? My thoughts may be all over the place, but the point is, I identify as nonpartisan because left wing, right wing, we’re all part of the same bird (the country), flapping in a direction and if we don’t remember the purpose it’ll crash."
US:194318471,Policy
US:183404425,I embrace and stand for the values embodied by the Republican Party. I feel so strongly regarding Republican representation that I became the Chairman of my county's Republican Party.
US:192766229,I believe in helping citizens and am pro education and pro choice. Religious beliefs should not dictate politics. There should be separation of church and state.
US:112518579,BECAUSE THEY ARENT FULL OF LIBERAL WHINERS

US:4391358,I feel like the democrats are liberals and I totally disagree with them on almost everything
US:41703957,"I feel the Democratic Party is for the working class. All the Republicans I've voted for in the past haven't helped the working class at all. They have opted to support the wealthy and large corporations. The Democrats have helped the poor, low-income ,and those in need."

US:192355809,Because their ideologies align with my belief
US:182724569,I have the same beliefs as Democrat's
US:25426507,"Because they are closest to my views and because we have a two party system, my REAL choice of/for a politician doesn’t stand a chance I think the democrats are, for the most part, beholden to the same special interests as Republicans. They are milquetoast and need to grow a spine and move LEFT and fight this fascism."
US:158639241,I believe in living within our means and dislike rampant spending with money we do not have.
US:43751436,"Democrats have positions and priorities that align most closely with my beliefs/morals. The Republican party no longer exists as an actual party, having been hijacked by MAGA/Trump and there is nothing about it that even comes close to my belief system. While I wish the Democrats would be tougher/fight harder, I could never consider being a Republican under the current leadership."
US:2560296,Democrats represent the middle class while Republicans show more favor to the very rich. Democrats are definitely more aware of social and moral issues than Republicans.
US:156013991,"Both the Democratic and republican parties are right wing parties. The democrats are center right, where the Republicans are far right, for the most part. They are two sides of the same coin. They keep us distracted by sowing seeds of discord over social issues, all while working together to make the rich even more wealthy by passing laws that favor those who line their pockets and fund their campaigns. The system is a duopoly and benefits only the wealthy capitalists, leaving the rest of the country to fight over the scraps. They view us as peasants. They work to undermine our education system in order to keep us stupid, without critical thinking skills. This country is a worldwide joke, and I'm ashamed of what we've become."

US:187424297,both sides do not rep the american people they are 2 both broken and need to be broken up and re formed
US:735263,"No party is perfect. But the democrat y party closely aligns with my liberal values and while getting things done in Washington isn’t easy because of polarization, democrats have done more for the working class, even though a lot of people do t understand or know that because they don’t pay enough attention, All the good social programs we have/had were put into place by democrats."
US:2473459,The Democrats are out of control and give too many things away. They have no backbone.

US:41196331,Person media is crucifying is only honest person in our government.
US:4365113,Sides are all or nothing and that gets us nowhere. Rabid leftists and staunch far right conservatives leave no air in the room. It's all black and white. I live in the gray.
US:28087888,"I was a liberal Republican until Trump ran in 2016. I will never vote for a Republican again. I am still in shock that a third of Americans support Trump, and will abandon our humanity to allow his fascist ideologies to become such a cesspool."

US:40015708,I have conservative values that align with the Republican Party.

US:1218565,I support the rule of law and the constitution. I believe in separation of church and state -that's the wall that needs most strengthening. GOP is moving backwards in time towards the 1950's and want a white christian theocracy. I believe diversity is our core strength - like most democrats
US:164657563,"They often lean towards the choices I would make, but locally, I have not always felt that way and voted for who I felt best represented my view points."

US:32544303,Because I have different thoughts on every issue.
US:36620325,I agree with the issues Republicans stand for and am against almost every issue Democrats stand for.
US:33758991,Republicons are weird and democrats don't have the people's interests at heart. They are both corrupt.

US:31928497,like what they stand for
US:184539457,It used to be that I believe in government that supports the greatest well being for the most of us. Now I would add to that it's because I am strongly anti-Trump and sickened by the lack of courage to do what's right in the Republican party.

US:101287711,"BECAUSE REPUBLICANS THINK LIKE THE PEOPLE, THE RATS THINK ONLY FOR THEMSELVES!!"
US:3095419,The democrat party has moved so far left that they are frightening to people that can think for themselves. They believe Government is the answer for everything. While I don't agree with everything the Republicans do they are closer to my beliefs. Bring on DOGE.

US:4541790,"Lifelong Democrat who believes that a free, diverse society that benefits all citizens, not only the wealthy and influential, is essential as is government administered under the constitution as originally written and lawfully amended through representative legislation. In the 20th and 21st centuries in the US, Democrats have done this better than the GOP."
US:179640819,I don’t know
US:29250191,I
US:2760261,Dems are to liberal and progressive. They make more government agencies so they can pilfer money and influence. Could care less about the people and want to fill their own pockets

US:183493947,I am in the middle because i do not believe how either party works
US:1535756,"I want to live in a society where hungry people get fed and unhoused people get shelter. I want education to be close to free at all levels and for capitalism to have firm guardrails that keep corporations from exploiting workers. I want bodily autonomy for all women and I believe LGBTQIA+ Americans deserve to live and thrive, with dignity and protections under law. I think that abortion is healthcare and that healthcare is a human right. I believe there is systemic and structural racism in our country and it continues to cause great harm to our citizens today. How to identify and dismantle racist ideology should be taught in schools, discussed in public forums, and supported by legislation. I value art and science equally, and want them funded and supported by my tax dollars. I want robust public health programs, including screenings, vaccinations, and sex education. I want our top-earning 5% of citizens to pay higher tax rates than they currently pay. I think every worker in America should be paid a living wage for full time work. I want common sense gun laws that allow us to limit the type, size, and magazine capacity of what is sold, and impose lifetime bans for people convicted of domestic violence. I would like to see America adopt ranked choice voting in elections, especially at the federal level. I want to continue to work with our international allies to support democracy and combat poverty. I believe people seeking asylum should be treated humanely at the border and families should stay together whenever possible. The values and goals that I wish to see reflected in my community are most frequently supported by the Democratic party."
US:22579723,Poor
US:4105071,I want low taxes and less government spending.
US:148930735,The Democratic Party has become very liberal and leaning socialist. Both parties lean to protect the status quo and the 40 year politicians who are only in touch with their fat wallets and out of touch with the majority of Americans
US:1514985,Do not threaten people of other parties
US:145903671,"I care about people and taking care of our fellow man. Supporting causes that help everyone move forward in life and provide for their families, not the top richest men in the country"

US:4175732,"Both parties are equally responsible the broken political system. Closed primaries limit voter options; eliminate gerrymandering, R & D work against choice; we need Instant Runoff/Ranked Choice, R & D create systems at the state level prevent competition."
US:151818767,Party aligns with my values
US:179264753,I agree with more republican policies and opinions; the democrats have gone off the deep end to radical left. Republicans are more of a common sense party.
US:32331702,"The conservative, pro-Christian party has always been Republican. I am a proud Christian who believes that the Constitution should be interpreted as it was written"
US:2171696,I have traditionally been a Republican my whole life. But since Trump came along and changed the entire party I have become disillusioned with the party.
US:24852791,I believe the Republicans are more honest than Democrats. And Republicans mostly stand up to defend the Constitution while Democrats want to rewrite it. Democrats have turned into Communists and Socialists. Republican still believe in the American Exceptionalism and freedom.

US:1663552,The political parties chose their party over their nation.
US:169679617,The Democrats are more reasonable than Republicans.The talk more about doing decent things for people.
US:192166469,Its too political and it gives me a headache. Everyone has their own opinion on this and that which is fine but it is also very overwhelming and some things that are said are quite stupid.
US:1801553,Because most of the Republicans do not go off the deep end and act like F____ing crazy people.
US:4391553,I believe in the things they try to fight for and the justice they create.
US:193797103,I believe they consider the voters opions.
US:159627681,"I agree with some of their policies, and with none of the republican."
US:517893,As I have gotten older I am becoming more liberal and I think the Republicans are trying to control peoples lives with their conservative opinions.
US:199836793,"I like how republicans do not cater to ALL. We need to protect Americans first. Stop giving money away to everyone else when we have enough problems here. We are left to struggle with no help when needed. Democrats like to give and give and all the democratic states are so bad, homeless people everywhere, streets are dirty because they do not do anything about it."
US:194041367,N/A
US:139943551,Republicans Party has become Fascist/Nationalist since the Error of Reagan was hijacked by Nazi sympathizers' Crotch Goblins. The Democrats have been Neoliberals shitbags since then too with being bribed by AIPAC funding both sides to further the push for Mas Genocide Globally not just in Palestine but Central & South America. As well as Middle East and Africa Nations to steal their resources. Zionists are behind the perpetual cycle of wars and government destruction to prevent Brown Skinned People from being given equality...

US:2289410,I hate the Republican party. They are horrible. They have no redeeming qualities. Everything they've wanted to do to this country in my life time has been disgusting. I vote for Democrats mainly because they are not Republicans.
US:26697587,My values do not even come close to the Democrats. I am more closely aligned to the independents and Republicans. I am more anti-Democrats than pro-Republicans.
US:35511755,"I'm more anti-Trump/Republican. However, I support the Democrat's effort to provide for regular people (not billionaires), ability to manage the government/country and their economic policies"
US:38972973,Truly American
US:39565961,Most Republicans and Republican 'values' are repulsive to my own beliefs
US:163749509,"I vote for the candidate, not the party, but I more often vote for the Democratic candidates."

US:4597905,"I believe in smaller government, conservative beliefs and less Washington involvement and more power to the states"
US:1222505,"Because they are more forward thinking and our for changing they way things are being done, that are no longer working or reflecting the citizen's views."
US:24504758,Because they are conservative and gave the same values and views that I do
US:155768465,I'm poor and Democrats usually side with poor people
US:2017672,Because socialism sucks
US:29042028,Neither party promotes the interests of working people. They're entirely too busy focusing on capitalistic ventures to enrich themselves and their backers.
US:4553317,I don’t know
US:179840541,My ideals align more with the Republicans.
US:127825569,"I do not like when government does everything for the people, we need to stand on our own two feet, get government out of our lives as much as possible"
US:42959564,Because I don't align with Republican values.

US:37454941,I have my own political beliefs.
US:42736762,Because democrats align with my values more
US:45936423,"Not applicable, I don't follow politics enough to chose either party at this time"
US:26627449,Their approach to government best matches my own.
US:114969649,Because the Republican Party has pretty much become a MAGA cult supporting Trump and dismantling whatever good things there were in place…and they are very isolationist when we should be more involved globally…and hurting our soft power policies
US:37271867,I agree with making America first. Securing our country and fair trade.
US:171750793,I have complete distrust of the current administration
US:3396197,"Mostly because I am Definitely NOT a Conservative! I think people should have the final vote and that government is here to “Serve the People” to make life better and more equatable for All People. I believe Greed is a disease and should be treated as such, much like depression and alcoholism."
US:1878505,I have seen how uniformly dishonest Democrats are.
US:29034038,Democrats make laws to protect people and make the country a better place. They follow the rules of the Constitution and choose people to represent them who are not simply grifters or toxic who want power and rewards for themselves.
US:181517223,Generally have more conservative values
US:186485455,"My political beliefs fall very firmly in the realm of today’s modern Democrat. Supporting public education, having a firm line between church and state, supporting common sense gun control such as proving a firearm can be responsibly owned and operated should be required, etc. I could go on but it’s overwhelming."
US:31214452,Neither party reflects what may be right for the country. Both push certain things but the Republucan parry has gone off the deep end. They have blunders on and following Trump and MAGA is disgusting. Completely ignoring facts and believing lies!!!

US:188484673,I align with their views way more than republicans.
US:201204915,"I believe in equal rights and protecting the less fortunate. Republicans seem to believe that Trump should be king, and I think there isn't much less American than that."
US:1225190,The Republican Party best reflects my values. I tend to be libertarian in some things and conservative in most things. Ronald Reagan was the best president of the 20th century. Donald Trump is tough enough to get the job done right now. Democrat party positions are ridiculous right now.
US:140110895,"I don't believe that it's okay to infringe on the rights of the American people, or minorities and Republicans seem to thrive on it."
US:2748101,Less government is the answer to most all questions. Rigorously enforce the existing laws on all people equally not just your political opponents. More public referendum questions on all ballots at all levels.
US:3369941,The Democrats stand for progress and government for the people. Values that I share. Plus I have voted since 1980 and it's always been Democratic. The Republicans have been taken over by the Felon in the White House.
US:40949911,I feel that both parties are more interested in protecting govt than they are the people.

US:139371,"conservative in my values, and thinking, and believe that we should give a hand up in situations, not a hand out."
US:35995730,I do not believe the Democrats or Republicans represent working people. They both put personal profits before anything else. And they both support war and genocide around the world.
US:3969356,No
US:4197315,"Democrats seem more accepting of people as a whole, wanting a cohesive society not belittling of others and equality."
US:171997711,"The democrats have moved far too left. I don’t support so-called “trans” (biological men) in women’s sports and don’t believe any child should be encouraged to “transition”. Those are completely anti-science positions. In addition, democrats are fighting the deportation of known criminals here illegally. They should not be backing these type of policies."
US:1248006,Because the republican party sees the government waste giving money to corrupt and unproductive people and governments under the disguise of aide. That only ends up in corrupt pockets.

US:182625143,Because I speak of the little people who fell ignored and belittled politicians only think on themselves then the people they swore to work for
US:41159889,I associate more closely with Republican views
US:3625372,Because I am socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Strongly believe in the rule of law.
US:167886407,I honestly don't i am more of third-party voter. Botgh sides are full of old rich white evil men that are greedy
US:118898483,Because of conservative viewpoint tend to be made from Critical Thinking and common sense.
US:145143765,Republicans have completely failed as a political party and have turned to worshiping a criminal. Republicans are powerless to stop the criminal they have enabled. Donald trump is a complete embarrassment to our nation. He has poisoned the republican party from top to very bottom local politics.

US:25480428,Both parties favor giving Israel money and weapons to genocide Palestinians
US:2340600,"The republican party is completely subsumed with trump worship, the democrats aren't even attempting to make a case to be a factor, I believe this is because the same corporations are paying both parties; there is no incentive to represent the people."

US:118280665,"I feel like a number of prominent democrat politicians have been taking increasingly radical positions lately, such as siding with known violent criminals merely to oppose the president's deportation orders.
