US:29454577,"I had been a Republican back in the 1970s and 1980s, but switched to Democrat when the Republican Party became infested with Rush Limbaugh. I switched back to Republican because of the Democrats supporting DEI and funding universities. The problem with universities extends beyond crazy left wing stuff. Science actually has become infected because too much money has been spent in it, and it has become a big bureaucracy, often advancing nonsense because people want to conform. I still do prefer the Democrats on smoking--they are more supportive of smoking bans in public places and other anti-tobacco measures. I slightly prefer the Democrats on other environmental issues, but they are now pretty weak. For example both Biden and Harris supported fracking, and the Democrats chose a coal lobbyist, Jaime Harrison, to be the head of the DNC just prior to the current head. Why did they do this?

I didn't agree with some of McCain's policies, either, but I believed he was a man of character. Clinton was such a shameful embarrssment.
