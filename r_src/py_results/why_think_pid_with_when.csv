I switched back to Republican because of the Democrats supporting DEI and funding universities. The problem with universities extends beyond crazy left wing stuff. Science actually has become infected because too much money has been spent in it, and it has become a big bureaucracy, often advancing nonsense because people want to conform. I still do prefer the Democrats on smoking--they are more supportive of smoking bans in public places and other anti-tobacco measures. I slightly prefer the Democrats on other environmental issues, but they are now pretty weak. For example both Biden and Harris supported fracking, and the Democrats chose a coal lobbyist, Jaime Harrison, to be the head of the DNC just prior to the current head. Why did they do this?

Reagan was the last Republican president to put the People before Party and Clinton the last to do so. Both were good Presidents and I voted for both of them. The Congress of both parties have been abysmally bad since well before either of those Presidents. Since 2000 the Democrat Party has promised greater equity and freedom for the People but seems to have launched into a crusade towards some kind of hybrid authoritarian socialism, communism or just plain lunacy where Government decides what is best for the nation and We the People as a result are less equal and much less free. The Republican Party likes to campaign on lesser, fairer taxation, smaller, less intrusive government, and more individual freedoms. Problem is they don't deliver on any of that. Even when they hold majorities in both the Executive and Legislative branches. Both sides are too full of themselves and their own narrow vision of what is good for the Country. And the Country? It's been run (into the ground) by a bloated, greedy, uncaring, Bureaucracy which has only grown larger since the 50's and whose only real interest seems to be in maintaining it's own power and control. I strongly supported the current President, Donald Trump, not because he is a Republican or a Democrat, he's been both. I support the man, not the Party. I do because he kept the promises he made his first term and he is keeping the promises he made this term. Most if not all of those promises based on what the people that voted for him (a majority of the country this term) voted for him to achieve. President Trump's methods can be absolutely cringeworthy at times but they get results. And it's about results, not the ""work"" or the ""process"" or any of the other useless BS that is used to justify or detract from the job he's doing. I've no idea whom I'll vote for in the next elections. I can tell you it won't be a Republican, Democrat or any other Party. I'll vote for the individuals that most represents the vision of Country I believe in and vote against every one of the incumbents that didn't follow through on their promises.

The same thing is true for all of my US Congressman too except for one Republican, Charles F. Dougherty, who served from 1979 to 1983. Every Democratic Congressman I have ever had went to prison for taking bribes. My current Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle has yet to be indicted. But his brother, Kevin Boyle a/k/a Hunter Boyle who was a state representative, was arrested several times for drunk driving, violating a protection from abuse orders and beating up his wife. His brother, the Congressman, did his best to try to cover the whole thing up by trying to manipulate the local justice system to have the charges dropped. If this happened anywhere but Philadelphia where the Democratic Machine Puppet DA motioned to have all charges dropped after Kevin Boyle was defeated in a Democratic Primary in the spring of 2024. Anywhere else Congressman Boyle would have been indicted on obstruction of justice charges and his brother would not have had his charges quietly dropped after he left office by a Democrat Machine Judge.

Their proposed $5000 baby bonus is not serious and would maybe cover 4 months of infant day care where I live (especially since the recently increase minimum wage is only $12.41/hr; almost 55% of a person's wages need to go to childcare costs).
