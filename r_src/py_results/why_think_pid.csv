US:116199799,"I was a staunch Democrat for most of my adult life and a union member. I was kind of center in most of my beliefs but the democrats seemed to more be in line with my values. Then they started to come after my guns and I began leaning towards the right and then they started wanting more rights for pregnant women and had no regard for the voiceless children and I leaned farther right. Then as a state employee whose union supported our democrat governor I watched as he adopted the same position regarding our union as the republican candidate and I began to vote republican. Then the affirmative action came and I as a management employee of the state was forced to hire not the best candidates for the job but minority candidates and I was required to stay within a strict budget while dropping my current suppliers of many different items and replacing them with other suppliers who sold the same products but at budget shattering inflated prices from minority owned businesses and I realized that the democrats were not about equality but about a whole different agenda and it kept getting worse to the point that I could no longer consider myself a centered democrat or even a right leaning one because the center line for me was so far to the right that I had no choice especially because it's only gotten worse with gays having special rights that I as a heterosexual don't have or minorities getting special treatment even though they are hardly a minority anymore and I couldn't understand why we didn't have equal rights anymore but specialized rights. The gun laws they keep proposing make it harder for me to get a weapon or ammunition to defend myself while they cry to defund the police so I can be defenseless and the bar keeps getting lowered in areas such as faith and abortion, the government in the hands of the left was leaning towards totalitarianism and I stopped recognizing my country anymore as they weakened our military and opened our borders and then told me there's more than two genders and our fucking sex was assigned at birth and we could change it at will contrary to the science they propose to support. That's why I am a registered republican and I consider myself a conservative because the few values I share with the liberals are not even considered left leaning any longer. I could write a book about it but my overpriced expired bacon that I got from the dumpster of my local supermarket where the blue haired gender fluid chick with a dick who was getting paid $20 an hour to take out the garbage chased me away because it was better that I should starve to protect its rights than for me to eat there fucking garbage.",0.28,505,-6.909708165391168
