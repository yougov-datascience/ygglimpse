He did this so he could say ""look what the republicans made me do"". Absolute coward move.   I was a republican at 18. I stayed that way until I got fed up with Republican lies -- like saying Barrack Obama voted ""present"" most of the time as a senator, implying that is a nothing vote. It is a meaningful vote, and it made me angry they tried to mislead me. I switched to Democrat. voted for Barrack. He escorted people out of Yellowstone, he forced through the Obamacare (illegally), he pitted blacks against whites. Moreover, I had switched to maintstream media, and the OBVIOUS and AGGREGIOUS lies they told daily dwarfed those presented by the republicans. It became apparent that the republicans were, by far, the lesser of two evils. Sadly, this disparity has become an unsurmountable chasm by now.

The Benghazi scandal was also incredibly eye-opening when Hillary said ""DOES IT EVEN MATTER AT THIS POINT"".. Shows that they are just involved in politics for their own monetary gain and literally do not care about the people who make up the backbone of this country.   In high school, they basically taught that the Democratic party was more modern and more for letting people do whatever they want with their lives with minimal gvnt intervention- which in theory sounds great. Who wouldn't want the freedom to make their own choices? When I was in college, I remember one of my professors asking if abortion was right or wrong. I answered that it's fine because the baby in the womb doesnt have consciousness and they dont know whats going on, so to set the pregnant woman up for a good life, it was acceptable. This was what we were programmed in school to believe - you can't have a baby and be successful. I was so ignorant. In my 20s, I learned about abortions and what they actually were, and that they stole the life of a person with unique code of DNA. Babies do have consciousness pre-birth and that is shown by their reactivity in the belly and their playfullness pre-birth. Looking back, it seemed like being a young democrat was the cool thing to do and showed to be more open minded. This was back when gays marrying was a huge thing. I thought that the gvnt should mind their own business about who wants to marry who so that was the leading decision for me. I thought the people should have freedom of choice with their own bodies, which I was not educated on. I still believe the gays should be able to marry, but the way things have been progressing with society regarding this trans stuff, whoever said it was a slippery slope was totally correct.

I was also sexually harassed and abused in a liberal school system. No one helped me, and I couldn't get any help because I was only a kid. Later on, I was raped by an acid dropping liberal boyfriend. It's a fact that under liberalism, violence against girls and women has skyrocketed. Even liberal feminists admit this is a problem. And yet, people defend it. God knows why, because this supposed ""progressive"" movement is full of hatred and abuse. I can post more examples, but this statement would turn into a book!
