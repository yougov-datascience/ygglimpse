When a party boos God and makes its major platforms about murdering unborn babies, mutilating minors, grooming children in grade schools, allowing men in women's sports and locker rooms, there is no choice in voting. I am a Republican because it is the party that is the most closely aligned with my religious views, which are what determine my actions. I am a Republican because I watched the government shut down our country based on a threat that did not exist. Covid was not that deadly and the actions taken destroyed businesses, children's learning and development and created mental illnesses in numbers we have not seen in decades. My Governor, Tim Walz turned into a dictator and a sick man offering money and scholarships to those who brought their children in for the deadly pretend vaccine. I am a Republican because even I could see that Biden was suffering from severe dementia even before he was elected and the Dems knew it and they allowed someone else to run and try to ruin our country. The mainstream media are not news shows, they are propaganda and brainwashing trolls that communists would love. I am Republican because I knew the Russia collusion was false, Hunters laptop was real, the impeachments and arrests of Trump were lawfare and January 6th was a set up and infiltrated with FBI and antifa to stir things up. I watched Minneapolis burn and the fake trial and the country go crazy with vandalizing and burning and killing and the Democrats were thrilled with it all. There is a severe sickness in the Democratic party and our news media and it will never align with people who wish to live their lives, protect others, help others and honor truth and service. The Dems are the lowest form of human in our country today. It is a sign. Those who scream their words, who use profanity (which children can hear) and attack, attack and attack are the ones who have the most to lose by Trump being President. They are criminals in my mind. Everyone I know, no matter which party they are in, want these 20 million illegals that the Dems let into the country deported. NOW. The Democrats are the ones using judges to slow everything done. They are all sick and frankly, evil. They hate this country. They hate the people of this country. No one does the things that Schumer, Pelosi, Waters, AOC, Crocket and that stupid shit who talked for 24 hours unless it is all about THEM. They do nothing to work in Congress to help this country. They can only tear down. Those who pushed people to destroy Tesla and Elon Musk are terrified on the money trail in USAID coming back to them. Those pushing for violence should be removed from office. All of these reasons are why I am sure I will be Republican until the day I die. President Trump truly loves this country and has given up more and taken more shit than anyone should have to, to serve his country. I am totally ashamed with the Dems in Congress.

They are speedily destroying every progressive advance of the last century and attempting to destroy our secular democracy, secular because the deistic Founders created it as such, in favor of theocracy and oligarchy. Furthermore, they are destroying the middle class, secular public education, access to higher education, and public health in order to create a sick, illiterate, and desperately poor populace unable to fight the increasingly powerful oligarchy and more likely to turn to the fairy tale of religion, just like it was in the Middle Ages. Key to all of this is to return women to the home to remain barefoot and trapped pumping out soldiers, laborers, and parishioners for the wealth and clerical class as it once was in feudal times. Rolling back women's reproductive rights and even the franchise as some in the GOP are seeking to do is the overarching goal. And don't get me started on the sick Republican obsession with eliminating gay and transgender rights. If able, they'd also willingly take up the cause of the old Southern Democrats of the Civil War era and return blacks and probably Hispanics or any dark skinned person to servitude. They value wealth, white European lineage, and the authoritarianism of Iron Age religion above all else and refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund a healthy, highly educated, and well functioning society. As for destroying the environment and ignoring catastrophic climate change, if there's money to be made, they couldnt care less. And finally the GOP is increasingly aligned with fascist leaders such as Victor Orban and Vladimir Putin, enemies of multicultural secular democacry. Republicans are the antithesis of everything that America has come to mean for the average American who is not a wealthy, heterosexual, Christian male. The Democratic Party has its problems, primarily being they are too far to the right in comparison to The Left of Europe and not agressive enough in fighting for the working class as they were in the era of FDR and JFK, but they are the only choice in our two-party system for this highly-educated, very liberal, fully progressive, environmentally aware, atheistic woman.",0.27,459,-6.891867118989602
