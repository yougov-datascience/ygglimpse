Who wouldn't want the freedom to make their own choices? When I was in college, I remember one of my professors asking if abortion was right or wrong. I answered that it's fine because the baby in the womb doesnt have consciousness and they dont know whats going on, so to set the pregnant woman up for a good life, it was acceptable. This was what we were programmed in school to believe - you can't have a baby and be successful. I was so ignorant. In my 20s, I learned about abortions and what they actually were, and that they stole the life of a person with unique code of DNA. Babies do have consciousness pre-birth and that is shown by their reactivity in the belly and their playfullness pre-birth. Looking back, it seemed like being a young democrat was the cool thing to do and showed to be more open minded. This was back when gays marrying was a huge thing. I thought that the gvnt should mind their own business about who wants to marry who so that was the leading decision for me. I thought the people should have freedom of choice with their own bodies, which I was not educated on. I still believe the gays should be able to marry, but the way things have been progressing with society regarding this trans stuff, whoever said it was a slippery slope was totally correct. I feel as if the democratic party preys on young people and convinces them to side with them with a common-sense kind of approach, although it is incredibly misleading.
